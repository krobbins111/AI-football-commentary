It is a brilliant, brilliant fixture, it's always been that way, other factors as well as football involved in the rivalry here, Barcelona and Real Madrid. Well, what an atmosphere inside the stadium and what a match we should have, star-studded line-ups here in front of us. Barcelona score plenty, they don't allow the opposition to score hardly any, so they get it right at both ends of the pitch. They've got some good individuals at the back and they've also got great understanding across that back line. It's a real group mentality in this line-up about pressing the opposition into making mistakes and cashing in on it straight away. Well, it takes a lot of energy, a lot of motivation, it's easy to drop off and when you do drop off that really aggressive closing down, that's when it can fall down. Barcelona's line-up here, Marc-Andre Testegen starts in goal, Gerard Pique starts with Samuel Umtiti as the centre-backs, Ivan Rakitic plays with Iniesta in the middle, Luis Suarez is the lone striker today. Well, you're too young, Alan, but I grew up watching Real Madrid win those European crowns in the 50s when European club football only just started and they made such an imprint on pretty much everywhere where the television pitches were beamed in those days and they've just moved on from strength to strength. Well, quite simply, they're one of the most famous football clubs in the world, aren't they? Perhaps the most famous. Able to cut that out with some sharp movement. Ivan Rakitic on the move and able to cut out the pass. Now Casemiro. It's good play until they got that challenge in. Ivan Rakitic. Sergio Busquets. That's a combination of skill and will to hold off the opposition. On the attack here. It's messy. I think he saw the look from the other player and saw where the pass was going and read it. Barcelona awarded the throw here. Sergio Busquets. Ivan Rakitic. Suarez. Now it's messy. That's very good shielding of the ball. Suarez. And it's a shot now. A cut out by Cristiano Ronaldo. The great Real Madrid hoping for victory here but knowing that it might not just be a goal a simple task. One or two tackles early on. He's given the free kick here. He's going to get his message across the ref. Jordi Alba. Modric. Here's Casemiro. I don't know whether the managers told them to do this but they're just defending deep and saying to the opposition you can have the ball. You're not going to hurt us. Played forward. A bit of menace in this attack. Gareth Bale. He stopped the opposition. Gets the ball out of harm's way. On to Ronaldo. Here's a chance to attack. Cristiano Ronaldo. He's got his shot off now. Well that was so close to going inside the post but it's just straight past the outside. Yeah, I think he's beaten the keeper, you know, but just not got it within the framework of the goals and he's a bit unlucky. The manager just hoping that that miss is not going to come back to haunt them. They are creating chances but that was a costly miss. Dembele. Luis Suarez. He's got some strength, hasn't he, to shield the ball like that. On to the attacking third. Iniesta. Just making sure that each pass is successful when they'll see a chance for a forward pass. Shots on here. Great save. So the corner to come. Another look at that effort on goal from Cristiano Ronaldo. Well only he will know whether he was going for goal there. In the end, he nearly scored. And in it goes, Busquets! Rafael Varane. Using his physical power to protect the ball. That's Casemiro. Kroos. Penzema. Quick-witted and quick in his movement too, to intercept there. Jordi Alba. Iniesta. Lionel Messi. Getting forward well as a team now. Passing build-up until that challenge. Real Madrid still trying to get an impact on to this game. Well they'll see this is a chance for Real Madrid from this corner. They've gone short with the corner. He can lay it off to the supporting player. All about picking the right pass now as he cuts it back. He's refused to be beaten here. Well, standing ovation from the fans and why not? What a stop. And Real Madrid get the corner. Corner from Toni Kroos. Good defensive clearance there. Now Messi. Iniesta. Luis Suarez. Modric. Kroos. Good football between these two. Nice passing. Sergi Roberto. Pique. Goes out wide to Messi. Modric. Here's Casemiro. Kroos. Modric. Toni Kroos. That's a combination of skip the break. In behind them now Luis Suarez. Ball in behind from Suarez. Backing his own skill. There's the opposition trying to nick the ball from him. Benzema. Cristiano Ronaldo. He'll need to try and get the ball back now. Benzema. Iniesta. And the time to be added on here is a minimum of three minutes. Real Madrid looking good with this attack. Here's Casemiro. Toni Kroos. Come away with the ball cleanly. Great tackle. Marcelo. Ronaldo. Now Casimiro, well that is halftime and the score is nil-nil here. Very well matched first half, very enjoyable and the visitors, well they are level at halftime but that normally rock-solid defense has been rocky. Yep, goalless and I just wonder whether we will see that net bulging at either end in the second half. All about picking the right pass now as he cuts it back. And here we go with the start of the second half. Sergei Roberto. Ivan Rakitic, now Messi. He has been pressed there to running the ball out of play. Sergei Ramos in control. It's Tony Kroos, always knows what he's going to do with the ball before he receives it. Really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now. Pulls it back now. Ter Stegen showing great reach, great reflexes. The corner safe, any keeper would be proud of. In from Kroos, not really away from the threat here. Here's Casemiro. Bale. He's got his shot off now. The goalkeeper comes out with a punch. Sergio Busquets. Luis Suarez. Lovely football, typical Barcelona. At least a fist away by the keeper. Jordi Alba. They've got numbers in this attack and it looks dangerous. Modric. Tony Kroos. On to Ronaldo. Modric. Here's Casemiro. Tony Kroos. No great danger here, but they've got the ball. That's the most important thing. Modric. The shot's off and there it is, the goal. Well, no wonder they're delighted because, what, five, six, seven players involved in that build-up. They all play an integral part. That was wonderful. And he has put that where it's impossible for the goalkeeper to reach it, right up into the top corner. Yeah, a couple of keepers wouldn't have got a hand on that. Well, let's take another look at the goal. I think the manager has decided that he wants to... Jordi Alba. Now it's Ousmane Dembele getting forward well as a team now. Luis Suarez. Jordi Alba. Dembele. Now it's Suarez. Lionel Messi. That's a good block. We're going to get a corner here because of that deflection. Activity on the bench for the losing team. A substitute getting ready to come on. Made away, well away from goal. Pique. Dembele. Tried to tackle here and he's done that. Modric. Nice interplay between the two of them. Modric. Isco. Now with Benzema. Ronaldo. Oh, what a fine goal. They lead by two now. They'll feel a little bit more comfortable and they're good value for this advantage at the moment. Great strike into the area where no goalkeeper in the world would have kept that out. He's been on full today. It looks like a striker on top of his game. Another angle on it here. Oh, he's loving it. The manager. He's seeing his team playing really well. Just what he was asking for. Restarting at 2-0. Real Madrid goal. Ivan Rakitic. Number seven. Sergio Busquets. Cristiano Ronaldo. Luis Suarez. There's some potential in this move. Quick-witted and quick in this movement too to intercept there. Modric. Bale. That looked very good indeed but the move has broken down. Paulinho. Luis Suarez. A little private game between the two of them. And the attacking now coming from Barcelona. He went in well. Dembele. Shots on here. Barcelona winning a corner. Aloft is the goal-scoring midfielder. He's getting a good clap and the fans here love him because he always puts in 100% effort. Paulinho. Very good distance to the clearance. Here's Cristiano Ronaldo. Marcelo. Matteo Kovacic. Carvajal. Well this attack has got a bit of menace to it. Benzema. That's great work by the goalkeeper. Sergi Roberto. Messi. Looking for Jordi Alba in the middle. Oh that's good defending. Here's Isco. Aldo. Marcelo. And they cut it out. Good idea. That's not executed with enough subtlety really. The run was a good run. Ivan Rakitic. That's good movement forward here. Kovacic. The shot gets blocked. Matteo Kovacic. The players a bit unhappy about this but we can see it again whether it should have been offside or not. It was called offside. Well who'd be a linesman but this linesman is one of the best and he gets it right here. Number 10, Luka Modric. Now Casimiro. Matteo Kovacic. Here's Isco, this is what you expect from Real Madrid, Casemiro, he's scored for Real Madrid. Well it's just a footnote to the match really, it confirms the win. I think the goal scorer will be pleased, another one for his tally late on the match here. Well we're in the last few minutes now, and the sky has been cast in this game really. Samuel Umtiti, Ivan Rakitic, Messi, Sergio Ramos, it's finished here. All about picking the right pass now as he cuts it back. Pulls it back now. A decent fist away by the keeper. Danger here, but they've got the ball, that's Modric. The shot's on! Isco, now with Benzema, Ronaldo. This is what you expect from Real Madrid, Casemiro, and he's scored for Real Madrid."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a British football commentator. Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, this is the Allianz Arena, the home of Bayern Munich. A big welcome to you all from myself, Martin Tyler, and from Alan Smith. Alan. Well, it radiates European history, doesn't it? It's a wonderful picture for us. We're lucky to be here, Alan. Bayern against Barca. Yeah, as soon as this draw came out, I've been looking forward to the tie. And I don't think we're going to be disappointed with the football on show here. Have a look at these two. Robert Lewandowski against Lionel Messi. What do you expect from them, Alan? Well, Robert Lewandowski, he's a top-class finisher. He gets himself in the box, and it's not often that he loses his head, as for Lionel Messi. He is known for his interplay, isn't he? Those little give-and-goes, cheeky ones with teammates, you just can't keep up with him. Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern! Bayern Munich's line-up. Manuel Neuer starts in goal. Mats Hummels plays with Jerome Boateng in central defence. Thiago plays with Arturo Vidal in the centre of the park. Robert Lewandowski is the main striker today. Barcelona's line-up here. Marc-Andr\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Testegen starts in goal. Gerard Piquet starts with Javier Mascherano as the centre-backs. Iniesta plays with Sergio Busquets in central midfield. Luis Suarez is the lone striker today. Well, you talk about Bernabeu being your favourite stadium, Alan, around the world. I think this is one of mine, the Allianz Arena, because it's great for commentating. Much, much closer to the action than we used to be in the old Munich Olympic Stadium. Yeah, never forget walking up here for the first time. He woke up in 2006 and it looked like a spaceship. And it lights up in different colours as well, doesn't it? It's an amazing arena. Javier Mascherano. Sergi Roberto. He's coming forward with some danger. Arturo Vidal. It's a real individual charge here with the ball. He's still going. Nicely played through ball. He's got his tackle in and the ball's gone out now. Arturo Vidal. There's the ball in. Defended to it first. Neymar. On to the attack now. Here comes the challenge. Eye-catching football, really. It just got to a stage where they actually took the eye off the ball, literally, and they've lost the ball. Here's a chance to attack. Trying to find an opening. Not panicking. Trying for Bayern Munich. Well, they're in a good position here. Trying to find M\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdller. It's Thomas M\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdller who's scored here. It's Thomas M\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdller who's scored here. No surprise in that. Well, that's an awesome goal. It's come in from a long way out, and from that angle it's not always easy to finish. Defenders caught out in the end. Well, he's a fantastic header of the ball and his marker stood no chance there. Bayern. And that has opened the scoring. 1-0 here. Barcelona benefiting from the referee's interpretation of that. Play on advantage. Sergio Busquets. Ivan Rakitic. Played down the wing, keeping the wide attack going. Building steadily here, keeping possession. Trying to find Suarez. Good stop by the goalkeeper. And now Iniesta. And the attacking now coming from Barcelona. Well, let's have another look at that because it was a very, very tight call. They were in otherwise. When I saw it first time of asking, I thought it was on, you know. But looking at the replay, what a good decision from the linesman that was. Robert Lewandowski. Here's a chance to move forward from midfield after that interception. It's looking good, this move. Looking for an opening with some good... The shot's on! Very good stop here. Corner now for Barcelona. Come on! Oh, good through ball. To level it up now. Messi! He's done it again. Come on! Come on! Well, very nicely placed, Alan. Beautifully done. Yeah, he's almost passed it into the net. Jimmy Greaves like that, wasn't he? A good look here again by the replay of the goal. Come on! Come on! So, away we go at 1-1. Pummels. David Alaba. Makes a challenge here. Sergio Busquets. Neymar. Jordi Alba. We can expect a very interesting match here with Barcelona looking for the victory. But they could be matched all the way. Now Ribery. Doing well to keep the ball. And now Iniesta. And here's the shot! Well on the frame of the goal. Good defending. And Neuer saves comfortably. Iniesta. Gets his foot in there. And the time to be added on here is a minimum of three minutes. David Alaba. Good pass. Getting it forward. Vidal's in the middle. And it's a header. And this will be a corner for Bayern Munich. Let's have a look at this, Alan. What's your view on it? The attempt from Suarez. I think he's actually trying to find the roof of the net, you know, with that side foot. But just lifting it too high to the bar. Intercepted well. Crisp defending there. Well, the referee is... Well, the action resumes now with Bayern Munich at the start of the second half. Lahm. A lot of defenders between them in the goal, but they still got the ball. Tried to tackle here, and he's done that. Well, they've got to chase back because with the turnover and possession, they could be vulnerable. He's coming forward with some danger. Well, they've been thwarted here. That's a sign of better things to come. Bayern Munich ready to bring on a sub. It's Messi. It's Messi. Shot blocked here. Well, that looked promising, but he's been stopped. Lewandowski. Robert Lewandowski. And they've cut it out. They're going to start from the back because it's a back pass to the keeper. Here's the referee. And it's Barcelona back on the ball now. Neymar. Luis Suarez. And Barcelona on the attack. That passing is top class. Neymar! It's another decent try, but we're still level in this match. and it's been an hour of very good football here we've still got 30 more minutes to go and I'm sure we're going to enjoy that as well Bayern Munich are ready with the change this is an exercise in patience as they try to get an opening Lionel Messi! terrific stop Barcelona winning a corner well you can see what they were trying to do just a bit too much height on it it's gone straight to the goalkeeper Barcelona get the throw Lionel Messi Ivan Rakitic here the challenge is a good one they've got the ball back Barcelona well the building steadily here working away defender to it first Bayern Munich given the throw just a quick check on the clock and there are 20 minutes to go looking at the bench it's Bayern who are making the move with the substitute into the attacking third it's good play until they got that challenge in here's the chance to get in the cross it's Robben well he's a clever dribbler but he's a very good finisher as well as that goal has just shown well he's knocked it in from almost on the line itself well we do often say he could have missed but I don't think he could have missed there Barcelona losing right now Lionel Messi going to be a substitute now for Bayern Munich for Suarez he's pinched it back again Joshua Kimmich I think the two teams are going to play on here but the referee has stopped it for this injury well the injured player has gone off we're going to get the game restarted with a drop ball it's noticeable that the home supporters are trying to help the team in this situation they're encouraged by the lead but they're fearful perhaps that this team might lose it well they won't want to give anything silly away the opposition are chasing the ball trying to get it back and trying to get back into this match well Gerard Piquet can't go back on that with any fondness trying to get the cross in, well blocked by the defender there is some backup for him in this position looking for Robben trying for Bayern Munich David Alaba right from the beginning we've never known which way this game is going to go and it's kept its drama right to the last could be dangerous they'll need to try and get the ball back now eye-catching football really it just got to a stage where they actually took the eye off the ball literally and they've lost the ball and shoots well saved and there it is the final whistle confirming victory for Bayern Munich well they wanted this friendly game to get themselves going again they've lost the game but in the end maybe there'll be more advantages than perhaps the result will suggest I think they were trying out one or two things out there that didn't quite come off but the manager might have finding it quite useful to see which of his players could adapt Here's Isco, this is what you expect from Real Madrid, Casemiro, he's scored for Real Madrid. Well it's just a footnote to the match really, it confirms the win. I think the goal scorer will be pleased, another one for his tally late on the match here. Well we're in the last few minutes now, and the sky has been cast in this game really. Samuel Umtiti, Ivan Rakitic, Messi, Sergio Ramos, it's finished here. All about picking the right pass now as he cuts it back. Pulls it back now. A decent fist away by the keeper. Danger here, but they've got the ball, that's Modric. The shot's on! Isco, now with Benzema, Ronaldo. This is what you expect from Real Madrid, Casemiro, and he's scored for Real Madrid."}]}

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And it's Portugal to play in this match today against Spain. The wonderful thing about a World Cup, it does bring together, Alan, countries that have a bit of previous in terms of form and history, and indeed rivalry, and we've got that kind of situation here. Yeah, when I saw this one, it always was marked out as maybe something special. I think the referee is going to have to be on his toes, he's going to have to have eyes in the back of his head at times. And now it's time for the National Anthems. Portugal have had a deserved reputation for decades, producing young, talented players. Obviously Cristiano Ronaldo has hogged the headlines in recent times, but he's not alone. And they're tactically very astute as well, Alan. Yeah, and this manager, he certainly knows what he wants from his players tactically. He usually gets it right. Looking at the line-up, he's got all the components in place, hasn't he? The manager for the pressing style of play has been a feature of his team. Yeah, and many an opponent has found it difficult to cope with. If your touch isn't spot on against this aggressive type of closing down, you're going to lose it in dangerous areas. Now look at the line-up for Spain. Diego Costa is the lone striker today. Great interest in this particular group, which is now underway, as the referee has signalled. Jordi Alba, it's looking good, this move. It's Isco. Put in from the wide area. That ball belongs to the goalkeeper. Able to cut that out with some sharp movement. Isco! Good block. That's deflected behind, it will be a corner. He's put in the corner. Defended well. Andre Silva. Plenty of room on the wing for Ronaldo. Iniesta. Silva. Pepe. William Cavallo. And Ronaldo. That's good movement forward here. William Cavallo. It's a fast start here. They deserve that goal, they'd be the better team early on. Really couldn't miss from there. The goalkeeper had no chance. Let's see the replay now. Real pleasure for Portugal, they've got this lead. Santiago Busquets. It's Isco. There's some potential in this move. Cut off! The shot gets blocked. Looked very good indeed, but the move has broken down. Now Guerrero. Now Adrian Silva. Andre Silva. He's coming forward with some danger. Semedo. And that's broken up by the defender before the cross could come in. Now this could be dangerous in a wide position. Diego Costa. And now Iniesta, supporting player alongside. Diego Costa. Thiago. Jordi Alba. He's got a chance to cross. Thiago. Busquets. Rafael Guerrero. He's got the technique to deal with the press. William Caballo. I would guess in this possession play here, they're trying to get the opposition to come out and carry them, and maybe bend past their way through them. Could be dangerous. And out wide they were in a good position until that defender acted very promptly and decisively. Carvajal. Silva. Now Jaume Aria. Portugal want to attack now. Typical of Cristiano. Ronaldo! Well, it looks a bad miss. I think the defender just put him off. Yeah, he's got to take a lot of credit for that because he had to take the shot quickly, the lad who was trying to score. Andre Silva. Trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. Coming up now, a corner. The ball's just deflected behind for that. Corner swung in. Shot's on here. But no scraps for the attackers to feed on from the goalkeeper that time. Hung on to the ball well. Carvajal. Diego Costa. And it's a good attack. Missed by Spain. Semedo. To Iniesta. Diego to Iniesta. Flash pointed and it's foul. Penalty for Spain. Penalty put away. Very neat penalty. Goalkeeper no chance. Very neat penalty. Goalkeeper no chance. The way he walked up to it, you could just see he was going to score. So confident. Here's the goal again. So, away we go at 1-0. Cristiano Ronaldo. Andre Silva. Now here's a chance to get at the opposition. Ronaldo Silva. Couldn't make a chance with this tackle. Cristiano Ronaldo. Chance taken. Goal. They're in front. Goalkeeper is annoyed with himself because he did get a piece of it. Not quite enough. I mean, it was half a hand, wasn't it? But it was well struck and too fierce for him. It's a shock for Spain. We're hearing there will be three added minutes here. movement forward here that is half time and we've reached it at 2-1 so we're underway the second half of this group stage match in russia and spain are behind i do think if spain continue knocking the ball about as they did they will create chances and score well he's had a go praise for trying the shot alan well his teammates aren't too happy and they've cut it out i like the look of this attack he's got his shot off now simple save for david de gea quick witted and quick in his movement too to intercept there good strong tackle your view alan smith on cristiano ronaldo's first half yeah what a good time to score that was a good side in the lead william caballo played down the wing keeping the wide attack going john martinio the shots off john martinio he must have thought he'd scored from that distance keeper had other ideas he's done some great protective work hasn't he this holding midfield player today and been rewarded really i guess you could say by getting a bit of a breather with the substitution now yeah it was always a key area this because he was up against a clever number 10 but he had the measure of him he came out on top john martinio went out for a corner he's put in the corner the ball's loose goalkeeper made the save but he couldn't hold it it would have been a good pass but it struck the ref diego costa it's a good cross good defensive clearance there tiago simple save for rui patricio on the move and able to cut out the pass and it's with danilo andre silva i do like this referee he's playing the advantage all the time and he's given portugal one now they've shown him the inside and he's taken that opportunity and here's the shot mario cristiano ronaldo here's a chance goalkeeper exposed tiago really working hard to be the controlling influence of this team you can almost hear his mind his brain ticking over down there now here's a chance to get at the opposition it is a substitution now to keep the team on their toes and to keep this lead they hope well that's proper defending they can't score from there it's out of play they gave it straight to him didn't they danilo perera and now iniesta tiago david silva got past his marker it's not really a way a chance not far away at all well if they keep creating chances i'm sure they'll take one that was a decent effort you know fantastic game this and it's going to go right down to the wire mario here's a chance to attack got the tackle in possession with portugal now slipped past his man now here's a chance offside called and we can see again now it's a good call i think it was and in the end not a difficult one because there was a couple of yards in it i think tiago able to cut that out with some sharp movement we're down to the last five minutes now and the margin is still just one goal and now bernardo silva really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now match elson olivera excellent defensive tackle silva tiago diego costa stared through by diego costa he's go he's go with this equalizing goal they fought back to level it up once more so that's a goal well worth analyzing again so extraordinary game here two very well-matched teams and they're trading goal for goal in the game portugal attacking now now that's a good block he's gone behind for a corner and this could yet be a decisive moment so late on good header back into the danger area the finish level as the referee blows the whistle for the last time really bad weather today really good game yeah we forgot about the weather only 10 minutes in because it was so entertaining great stuff if you want more fifa world cup action then check out the side we managed to put together in our ultimate team draft Here's Isco, this is what you expect from Real Madrid, Casemiro, he's scored for Real Madrid. Well it's just a footnote to the match really, it confirms the win. I think the goal scorer will be pleased, another one for his tally late on the match here.

Paris Saint-Germain today involved in our match against Barcelona. I'll be keeping an eye out for those runs towards the near post from Edinson Cavani. He loves to get to corners in front of defenders and scored a lot of goals for clubs and for country like that. Yeah, very strong in the air. I'm sure that is something that the opposition manager would have spoken about to his defenders before this match. Well, we expect Lionel Messi to be the master of the ball and probably the master of the game as well. Well, he's obviously the man to watch and the man to mark. Interesting how the opposition do try and cope with him. I've seen him man-marked out of a game before but not many times. Paris Saint-Germain, this is their line-up. Thiago Silva plays with Marquinhos in central defence. Adrian Rabiot plays with Marco Verratti in the middle. Edinson Cavani is the main striker today. Looking at the line-up, he's got all the components in place, hasn't he? The manager for the pressing style of play has been a feature of his team. Many an opponent has found it difficult to cope with. If your touch isn't spot-on against this aggressive type of closing down, you're going to lose it in dangerous areas. This is where France got one of their first real trophies. A nation that have produced people who have invented the game like Jules Rimet and Henri Delornais. Invented competitions as we know it today. And the Champions League European Cup came with French origins. And France won that 84 European Championship trophy. They beat Spain 2-0. Yeah, plenty of big games, memorable games here. You used to see the Rugby Union here as well before they moved across to the Stade de France. And now Iniesta. Ivan Rakitic. Jordi Alba. There's a dangerous feel to this attack. It's looking good from their point of view. All right. Defender has to move quickly. Rabiot. Neymar. Iniesta. Delefeu. Moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here. Neatly intercepted. Rabiot. This is how they love to play on the break. Neymar, the offside player. Yeah, he's having a little go at his teammate. He did want that pass earlier. Iniesta. Jordi Alba. And the ball returned to Iniesta. Tackle here. He's cut that out. Well, well read. Jordi Alba. Ivan Rakitic. Delefeu. Neymar. Rabiot. Luis Suarez. There's some potential in this move. It's on the move all the time and makes lots of these interceptions. Berati. Now Dani Alves. Luis Suarez. Neymar. Rabiot. He's got the ball there in the defensive zone by reading the play very well. On to the attack now. The cross goes towards the far post. That's a great finish for the first goal of the day. It was a move to make your mouth water. Great goal. I think he's picked him out from that left-hand side. Wonderful delivery. Really an accurate cross. Well, he's just got ahead of his marker, pure and simple, and he wanted it more. Showing his frustrations, the manager. I'm sure he'd love to be out there playing himself, but he can't, and his team are losing now. Barcelona, then, with the lead. Berati. Thiago Mota. Rabiot. Edinson Cavani. Attacking now. You don't see that so often. Just glided past him effortlessly. It's Messi. It's Messi. It's Messi. It's Messi. It's Messi. Berati. Over the top, towards Neymar. Trying to hit Cavani in the middle. It's saved by Marc-Andre Tostega. Piece of interplay between the two. Neymar. On to Mbappe. And a try one now. Mbappe. Dani Alves. Cavani. That was a good chance to get level here. Well, it certainly was. Good move, too. And give him another chance. I think he might take it. It's Mbappe. It's Mbappe. It's Mbappe. It's Mbappe. It's Mbappe. It's Mbappe. It's Mbappe. It's Mbappe. He knows it, the manager. A golden opportunity to get back on level terms. That was really slacked by the striker. And now Iniesta. Lionel Messi. De La Feu. De La Feu. Fantastic save. Safety first from the defender. Can't blame him for that. Dembele. What an opportunity if he picks out the right man. At full extension, the goalkeeper makes the save. Well, they might not be rushing to take the corner. A goal to the good, of course. Played in by Messi. Pique! Cleared away by the defender. Tight against the touchline. Pretty clear that it was going to end up with a throw-in. Suarez. It's a deeper position, but he's happy there. And he's got possession on the move and able to cut out the pass. Thiago Mata. Now here's a chance to get at the opposition. Cavani. And a shot! Berati. And the verdict on added time is two minutes. He's very confident with the ball at his feet. A chance to break away now on the counter. Able to cut that out with some sharp movement. Well, the referee has signalled for half-time and it's 1-0 here. Well, the player that we're featuring here has done well. He's certainly been an influence on this first half. Well, he played really well, didn't he? And he got himself a goal to put his team ahead. He'll be pleased. Second half underway. Barcelona have got the lead. Trying to stretch the opposition using the wider areas here. Suarez. Free kick given. Suarez. Free kick given. has a go here and the goalkeeper he just anticipated the direction of the free kick anticipated well Adrian Rabiot giving the opposition a problem with their interpassing now Dani Alves Pique Dembele treads it through they could pose some danger now that's a wonderful tackle Dembele, Messi, Messi the defenders managed to get in the way there trying to get the throw, I'm ready to make a switch now Messi on to Jordi Alba back with Messi, Messi saved by the goalkeeper at full stretch neatly intercepted he's coming forward with some danger Cavani it's a goal in their level really couldn't miss from there, well the keeper had no chance I want to see this again this goal Iniesta is off so away we go at one all Ivan Rakitic advantage applied there for Barcelona moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here Neymar Javier Pastore, Beratti, he slipped his man Paulinho, now Messi he's got it back again from his teammate it's Messi, incisive pass into the attacking third he's taken a touch there of the defender it will be a corner having played the advantage he's now going back to deal with the infringement that he could have blown for and the offender is going to get a yellow card yeah I wonder whether he thought he got away with that because the play was allowed to go on but no he sees yellow in goes the corner good defensive clearance there Angel Di Maria, Cavani can't keep the ball at the moment, Pique Lionel Messi attacking well here pulls it back now and a goal he looked the goalkeeper in the eyes and said right I've got the win here and he's got the goal to show that I love that kind of finish when you don't have to blast it as long as the placement is right the goal conceded and they are losing at the moment Paris Saint-Germain here's Marquinhos Angel Di Maria well he makes that transition happen quickly crafting the through pass hit in hard and low oh they lead by two now took the chance nicely and that really has given them much more of a basis for the rest of this match the goalkeeper left totally isolated here and the two attackers just worked it past them for a simple goal yeah they used the heads the lady in possession didn't try and go for glory he knew when to release the pass and he did just that just a reminder 3-1 it is now for Scola, Peratti now Dani Alves attacking now here's Dani Alves Kozawa, Cavani here's a shot now well they've all gone to the defender to say well done but I think the guy who had the chance really should have scored well he had the chance to get his shots away even though he had to take it quickly should have done better and the manager Alan is making this change here substitution will take place wonderful to watch he took those two goals superbly well that's a decent stop but not perhaps one for the top 10 no but he was on his toes wasn't he he was ready for it and he can take possession in his own half Tiago Silva he's cut that out well well read Andre Gomez in comes the challenge Rabiot Lionel Messi Barcelona awarded the throw here Messi good vision in behind them now Luis Suarez he's tried to hit this one too hard Alan hasn't he oh I think he shanked it Martin miles off target in the end so Lucas Paris Saint-Germain smoothly through the gears here Neymar to Andre Gomez Ferrati, Dani Alves, Di Maria he's got his shot off now no goal well that assistant there he was certain the flag went up straight away Lionel Messi Andre Gomez getting forward well as a team now good vision and the goalkeeper got across to it that's the end of the game pleased to win the match I guess because that's what you do whenever you play but as a friendly game more than just a result Alan for them I think so they'll take a lot of heart from that because uh not only did they win but they played well along the way what a brilliant performance from this fella well so often we think of his creative abilities but a couple of goals here have won the match for his team"}]}

The wonderful thing about a World Cup, it does bring together, Alan, countries that have a bit of previous in terms of form and history, and indeed rivalry, and we've got that kind of situation here. Yeah, when I saw this one, it always was marked out as maybe something special. I think the referee is going to have to be on his toes, he's going to have to have eyes in the back of his head at times. And now it's time for the National Anthems. Portugal have had a deserved reputation for decades, producing young, talented players. Obviously Cristiano Ronaldo has hogged the headlines in recent times, but he's not alone. And they're tactically very astute as well, Alan. Yeah, and this manager, he certainly knows what he wants from his players tactically. He usually gets it right. Looking at the line-up, he's got all the components in place, hasn't he? The manager for the pressing style of play has been a feature of his team. Yeah, and many an opponent has found it difficult to cope with. If your touch isn't spot on against this aggressive type of closing down, you're going to lose it in dangerous areas. Now look at the line-up for Spain. Diego Costa is the lone striker today. Great interest in this particular group, which is now underway, as the referee has signalled. Jordi Alba, it's looking good, this move. It's Isco. Put in from the wide area. That ball belongs to the goalkeeper. Able to cut that out with some sharp movement. Isco! Good block. That's deflected behind, it will be a corner. He's put in the corner. Defended well. Andre Silva. Plenty of room on the wing for Ronaldo. Iniesta. Silva. Pepe. William Cavallo. And Ronaldo. That's good movement forward here. William Cavallo. It's a fast start here. They deserve that goal, they'd be the better team early on. Really couldn't miss from there. The goalkeeper had no chance. Let's see the replay now. Real pleasure for Portugal, they've got this lead. Santiago Busquets. It's Isco. There's some potential in this move. Cut off! The shot gets blocked. Looked very good indeed, but the move has broken down. Now Guerrero. Now Adrian Silva. Andre Silva. He's coming forward with some danger. Semedo. And that's broken up by the defender before the cross could come in. Now this could be dangerous in a wide position. Diego Costa. And now Iniesta, supporting player alongside. Diego Costa. Thiago. Jordi Alba. He's got a chance to cross. Thiago. Busquets. Rafael Guerrero. He's got the technique to deal with the press. William Caballo. I would guess in this possession play here, they're trying to get the opposition to come out and carry them, and maybe bend past their way through them. Could be dangerous. And out wide they were in a good position until that defender acted very promptly and decisively. Carvajal. Silva. Now Jaume Aria. Portugal want to attack now. Typical of Cristiano. Ronaldo! Well, it looks a bad miss. I think the defender just put him off. Yeah, he's got to take a lot of credit for that because he had to take the shot quickly, the lad who was trying to score. Andre Silva. Trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. Coming up now, a corner. The ball's just deflected behind for that. Corner swung in. Shot's on here. But no scraps for the attackers to feed on from the goalkeeper that time. Hung on to the ball well. Carvajal. Diego Costa. And it's a good attack. Missed by Spain. Semedo. To Iniesta. Diego to Iniesta. Flash pointed and it's foul. Penalty for Spain. Penalty put away. Very neat penalty. Goalkeeper no chance. Very neat penalty. Goalkeeper no chance. The way he walked up to it, you could just see he was going to score. So confident. Here's the goal again. So, away we go at 1-0. Cristiano Ronaldo. Andre Silva. Now here's a chance to get at the opposition. Ronaldo Silva. Couldn't make a chance with this tackle. Cristiano Ronaldo. Chance taken. Goal. They're in front. Goalkeeper is annoyed with himself because he did get a piece of it. Not quite enough. I mean, it was half a hand, wasn't it? But it was well struck and too fierce for him. It's a shock for Spain. We're hearing there will be three added minutes here. movement forward here that is half time and we've reached it at 2-1 so we're underway the second half of this group stage match in russia and spain are behind i do think if spain continue knocking the ball about as they did they will create chances and score well he's had a go praise for trying the shot alan well his teammates aren't too happy and they've cut it out i like the look of this attack he's got his shot off now simple save for david de gea quick witted and quick in his movement too to intercept there good strong tackle your view alan smith on cristiano ronaldo's first half yeah what a good time to score that was a good side in the lead william caballo played down the wing keeping the wide attack going john martinio the shots off john martinio he must have thought he'd scored from that distance keeper had other ideas he's done some great protective work hasn't he this holding midfield player today and been rewarded really i guess you could say by getting a bit of a breather with the substitution now yeah it was always a key area this because he was up against a clever number 10 but he had the measure of him he came out on top john martinio went out for a corner he's put in the corner the ball's loose goalkeeper made the save but he couldn't hold it it would have been a good pass but it struck the ref diego costa it's a good cross good defensive clearance there tiago simple save for rui patricio on the move and able to cut out the pass and it's with danilo andre silva i do like this referee he's playing the advantage all the time and he's given portugal one now they've shown him the inside and he's taken that opportunity and here's the shot mario cristiano ronaldo here's a chance goalkeeper exposed tiago really working hard to be the controlling influence of this team you can almost hear his mind his brain ticking over down there now here's a chance to get at the opposition it is a substitution now to keep the team on their toes and to keep this lead they hope well that's proper defending they can't score from there it's out of play they gave it straight to him didn't they danilo perera and now iniesta tiago david silva got past his marker it's not really a way a chance not far away at all well if they keep creating chances i'm sure they'll take one that was a decent effort you know fantastic game this and it's going to go right down to the wire mario here's a chance to attack got the tackle in possession with portugal now slipped past his man now here's a chance offside called and we can see again now it's a good call i think it was and in the end not a difficult one because there was a couple of yards in it i think tiago able to cut that out with some sharp movement we're down to the last five minutes now and the margin is still just one goal and now bernardo silva really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now match elson olivera excellent defensive tackle silva tiago diego costa stared through by diego costa he's go he's go with this equalizing goal they fought back to level it up once more so that's a goal well worth analyzing again so extraordinary game here two very well-matched teams and they're trading goal for goal in the game portugal attacking now now that's a good block he's gone behind for a corner and this could yet be a decisive moment so late on good header back into the danger area the finish level as the referee blows the whistle for the last time really bad weather today really good game yeah we forgot about the weather only 10 minutes in because it was so entertaining great stuff if you want more fifa world cup action then check out the side we managed to put together in our ultimate team draft"}]}

Well, if you keep going in to that sort of area, the ball will drop for you, and it dropped perfectly for him. I think that's the lesson to anybody enduring a goal drought, keep getting in to the positions in the 18-yard, in the 6-yard box, and you will score. Off we go again, 2-1. Well, he puts up an impossible. Jaka. These two have got a great understanding with their passing. Aaron Ramsey. Excellent interception. Here's a chance to attack. He's through here! Maniama. Dele Alli. Proper tackle, that. Kamali Jaka. Anticipated the direction of the pass, and was able to intervene. Lacazette. Getting forward well as a team now. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. He's making sure that each pass is successful. When they'll see a chance for a forward pass, they'll flick a switch. Lacazette. Quick-witted, and quick. Well, this is half-time, that's the whistle. And 2-1 is the score at this stage. A brilliant first half from this fella. On top of his game out there, and I'm sure he'll be thinking about grabbing his hat-trick in the second half. It's a combination of skill and... Sanchez! Lacazette! That's a serious situation. It's a very serious situation. That's a serious situation. He's in! Lacazette! On to Moussa Dembele. And it could be for Tottenham! It's a goal! It's a goal! It's a goal! It's a goal! They've decided to make a change. And being behind, you can understand that. Number 7, Valentino. Start of the second half, with Arsenal in front. Mesut Ozil. Packing now. Surging forward with the ball at his feet, Lacazette. Ramsey! Real chance! Back off the bar! Victor Guadalajara. Danny Rose. Kane. Moussa Dembele. Now this looks promising. Rose. Song. Goal! Mesut Ozil. Diaka. Directing the traffic at the moment. Moussa Dembele. Yeah, and can anybody stop him? Good screening. And he's kept the ball. That's a foul by the Arsenal man. Well, that episode is going to lead to a yellow card from the referee. Well, look at the ref, he reached for his pocket straight away. No hesitation from him. Is that just a case of mistiming the tackle? Didn't look comfortable going into it, and it was a definite foul. Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! And now the shot! That was the opening that they've been working so hard to get, to get back on level terms. And you're right, Martin, they have worked extremely hard. Just let down at the death there, what a miss. Goal! Goal! Goal! Played forward, a bit of menace in this attack. Goal! Victor Wanayama. Goal! He's read that, hasn't he? And made the interception, made it look easy actually. Alexis Sanchez. Wasteful pass. Unforced error really. Song. Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Song. Wonderful save from Cech. Oh, I thought that was it. Oh, how about this. Listen to the crowd now. He's coming off having really taken this game by the scruff of the neck. He's a real favourite with these fans. An even bigger favourite now after that performance. In goes the corner. Defended well. Coming on strong and looking to play their way through now. Toby Alderweireld. Danny Rose. In quickly. It's a very good skill. He's made the defender look a bit awkward there. He saw the look from the other player, saw where the pass was going and read it. Deleza Ozil. Moving forward with Menes. And there is the interception. Musa Dembele. Christian Eriksen. Sanchez. On the attack here. Mesut Ozil. Alexis Sanchez. Kocelan. Ramsey. It's good work between these two. Christian Eriksen. Eriksen. Danny Rose. Victor Wanayama. Kane. Moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Wider than where he's been playing, Alexis Sanchez running a bit of room now. Ozil waiting in the middle for the cross. And that's a corner for Arsenal. Well there's still time to hit back in this game and they're going to try and do it with a substitute. It's Ozil's corner. Well the play has broken down now. Ramsey. Sanchez. That's the upside of being a goalkeeper. We've seen the downside in some of his work earlier in the game. But good stop this time. Yeah it was a decent stop. You'd expect him to make it but not his day really generally. Corner taken by Ozil. It could be a chance. Here we go Loris. Stops it comfortably. Moussa Dembele, Danny Rose Could be a chance here, they've got the ball into a good area Well Harry Kane on the radar for the crosses And they get it away Ramsey, this turnover could be costly against a side that can break like this Still progressing on the break Aaron Ramsey And there is some back up for him in this position It's a terrific effort by the home side here They've just kept their noses in front They're going to need all the support they can get For that to continue to the final whistle Yeah if they do end up winning this they will have their fans to thank Because they've been terrific out there today Rose Tackle goes in Mesut Ozil Lacazette Sanchez Aaron Ramsey And here they are on the attack Another turnover in play here with that interception Moussa Dembele Danny Rose Excellent work with the tackle Trying to get behind the defenders to get in a good cross Song Dembele Now Song That's the referee's decision, two added minutes Here's Winks Dembele Now it's Song There is the final whistle What a brilliant performance from this fella Well so often we think of his creative abilities But a couple of goals here have won the match for his team Song Combination of skill and Sanchez Lacazette That's a serious situation He's in Lacazette Song On to Moussa Dembele And it could be for Tottenham It's a goal Song Wonderful save from Cech I thought that was in Ramsey Sanchez"}]}

I'm Martin Tyler along with Alan Smith. I I Just wonder as we look ahead to another North London derby where the Tottenham have concentrated too much on trying to catch up with Arsenal And just play the season as it is and if they finish above our store, well great that's happened because they've had a good season Well, that's right We often talk about a shift in power what we see might be a shift in power at the start of the season But it hasn't quite happened yet. Has it? Well much of the 16-17 season Surrounded for Arsenal in the debate about the future of Arsene Wenger who then defied his critics by winning the FA Cup Yes, and a fine performance. It was at Wembley that day The fans will want to see them kick on from that When Arsenal moved here, they put up the dates of the club's successes around the stadium But for a while there was nothing that had actually happened since the Emirates have been the home ground But of course in 2014 and 2015 They won the FA Cup on both occasions and they'll be hoping that opens the floodgates in that respect Yeah, I think that's what this ground is missing history One of the great young talents around Germany's measure as ill such an elusive little customer Wonderful ability to pop up in the box Another angle on it here And that has opened the scoring 1-0 There's good progress with this attack And That's taking the heat out of the situation for the moment with that interception Tottenham given the throw that's a fine go up. I want to see it again. I bet you do too Well, yeah, I think he will want to see it again as well tonight. Great finish. No, I'm Kasi Elnay I Try to find Alexis Sanchez great work by the goalkeeper the ball is his knees made sure he's protected it First get the referees advantage Moussa Dembele The goalkeeper has pulled off a really good save, but that's when he needs the help of his defenders Arsenal now the keepers pulled off a really good save, but that's when he needs the help of his defenders That's a goal well worth analyzing again Restarting at 2-0 Kane Aaron Ramsey I've got the ball in the middle of the pitch here The tackle there is successfully done when I need Chaka Ramsey Well, you can see what he was trying to do but the pass wasn't on it was a bad ball as it turned out Just too hard And he's used his head there to keep his side in possession They've licked up. Well, he's got a shot off now a decent effort just just off target Yeah, unlucky because he got some power beyond the ball. Just not the direction Chaka It back again Moussa Dembele Sanchez Aaron Ramsey Excellent play to lose his market Here's the shot Moussa Dembele So Really trying to use the full width of the pitch here to make some progress Christian Eriksen, that's the way to win the ball back Oh And I need Chaka That's it Proper clearance well away from the danger zone Well, that's a good block that's an easy intersection because the pass wasn't really a very thoughtful one Oh Kossi Elnay, that's a fine tackle measured Urziel That's a good challenge between the two of them there Moussa Dembele Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Aaron Ramsey He can hit it here keep it might be needed again he didn't hang on to the ball Commanding Chaka And he's not let the ball escape his grasp Alexis Sanchez Here's a chance for Arsenal. Sanchez. Goalkeeper hangs on. That is a cheap piece of play to give the ball away like that. And the tackler has been very successful there, he's got possession. Kane. And the referee has blown for half time, it's 2-0 here. After all the talk, the players are trying to walk the walk and it's been difficult as you would expect in a derby. At the moment one team a little happier than the other. You can feel the tension within this stadium, I think the crowd understand that. So here we go for the second half. Aaron Ramsey. That's safely away. Offside called and we can see again now. That was a good call. Yeah I think it was. And in the end not a difficult one because there was a couple of yards in it I think. Lacazette. Well that's a clever little clip into a team-mate. Cleared it well. Lacazette. He's gone in strongly and got the ball. Ramsey sees that as a foul and it is a free-kick. Lacazette. Opportunity now. Lacazette. Terrific stop. It's a corner for Arsenal here. A strong, powerful clearance and Arsenal have possession, they've won it. Here comes the cross. Kane. Well you can see what he was trying to do but the pass wasn't on, it was a bad ball as it turned out. It's Tottenham who are going to make the change. Goal kick to come. Activity on the bench for the losing team. Substitute getting ready to come on. Song. Kanayama. Gnani Chaka. Sanchez. It's offside and the referee has given it. And from the Spurs sidelines a substitute is going to come on. Well that's very good positional play and he's read the situation perfectly with that interception. Lacazette. In towards Ozil. Here's a chance. Out in front of goal. Song. That will help ease the pressure. Sanchez. If you look at the coaching manual, you don't defend. What a fine save. Corner for Tottenham. They've decided to make a change and being behind you can understand that. And it's a headed effort at goal. Tottenham have scored. Here we go again. 2-1. Tobi all the way out. Davis. Terrific tackle. Here's an Ozil crossing. Good stop by the goalkeeper. Guided on by his head. And they've got the ball still. He wants to play on the shoulder of the last defender. He's just got to get it right. It's all about timing. Arsenal have the ball again. Lacazette. Mesut Ozil. Crosses in. Tight margins. He's just put too much on it. It's over the bar. Able to make a good interception. Well, we've had some chances, Alan, but it's a while since we've had a goal. They've still got the lead. Yeah, and they're knocking the ball about with a fair bit of confidence. And they look pretty secure with this lead at the moment. That could soon change, though, of course. Well, they've got to get goals, haven't they? And the only way to do it, the manager thinks, is to get another attacker on. Foul called against Arsenal. Christian Eriksen. Kane. Played down the wing, keeping the wide attack going. Well, he's pulled up there. That could be a pulled muscle goal kick here. Well, the manager will be delighted with the way his team have played so far, but he's going to make a substitution here just to hope that he can retain this lead. We're down now to the final two minutes of the 90. And he's moved in, trying to jostle the opponent off his stride. Lacazette. Theo Walcott. And we're hearing there will be three added minutes here. Theo Walcott. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Komanichaka. Davis. Well, he's won the ball well forward here. Well saved. This could be what they call the insurance goal, couldn't it? To make sure of the victory, to turn a one goal lead into two. And no time for recovery, really, if they were to get the goal. And he can clear it here. Well, there's the final whistle.

Welcome to it Martin Tyler here along with Alan Smith Well, we don't need to build this one up too much out of two it speaks for itself Barcelona and Real Madrid Yeah, one of the clashes in world football, isn't it? So many stars on both sides. Can't wait for this one And it's Barcelona. We're watching today This season I know there's still a long way to go but we all expected them to be champions They're looking like that in these early stages I think it's that's a girl Today is the center backs and he asked the players with Ivan Rakitic in midfield. Leonel Messi is the main striker today It's Casimiro But There's a man Benzema good challenge Tony Kroos with Benzema whale Ronaldo the target in the middle and that's easily dealt with by test a gun It's round Madrid looking for a win but knowing that they've got to be on their toes today This looks dangerous for messing Luis Suarez Messick Fantastic start really quick of the blocks here. They've given themselves a terrific boost for what lies ahead Fantastic football really to go like that Sometimes as a defender, you need a bit of luck Different angle on it here Barcelona with the lead Modric nice return pass Moving forward with some danger to the opposition now, they're here Promising build-up until that challenge. I've lost the ball and the counter-attack could be there Messi now in full cry He's frustrated because he is caught offside Maybe he made his run a bit too soon Yeah, he's having a little go at his teammates. He did want that pass earlier It's Casimiro Luis Suarez Trying to switch on me. He's had a go at Messi. That's about the best you can say. He was a long way out Yeah, I think that's a waste to try his luck from there Now Casimiro There's a dangerous feel to this attack It's looking good from their point of view and the goalkeeper can take charge now Here's the shot He wasn't fazed by facing a player who's already got the better of him in this game Well, he's got his defenders out of jail there because that or the goalkeeper takes charge here from the court And he's got a chance to get a free-kick Nice bit of interplay between these two. There's some potential in this move Oh No idea. No, he's miscued that one miscued it badly. Oh, here it is again. De La Feo's goal Rafael Varad Gross Tony cross on the attack here What we get to see of course the assistants don't whether that'll change down the years I'm not sure. But anyway, the replay here shows he's got it, right? He has there was no real goal scoring chance, but the defense would be pleased that their organization caught him up Could be a chance here. They've got the ball into a good area De La Feo From the cross supported there as he I Cut it out Modric Well, there is cover if he loses the ball and he won't want to do that here that's the referee's decision to add in minutes Slipping it through Level He's Got everything in his locker Cristiano Ronaldo and goal scoring is the hardest thing in the game and he does it he makes it Look easy as he has done again here. He's a coach extreme a goal scorer superb. That was So away we go at one all While the referee is blown for halftime at one one So That is time now for the start of the second half Marcello now, they're looking for room in a wide position PK Oh Modric Now here's a chance Here's a chance to attack good defending Modric Modric Kareem Benzema Johnny Frost Completely intercepted looking good this move Even racket edge Modric I gave it straight to him didn't I Sergio Busquets? He's put it over We're gonna see a change here for Real Madrid And the attacking now coming from Barcelona lost the ball it's a poor touch Headed towards where a teammate can gather the ball On to Ronaldo Sergio Busquets into the attacking third probing with the pass Suarez Goalkeeper dismissed Luis Suarez on target again. Yeah, the pass perfectly timed and so was the run So it's a goalkeeper dismiss Luis Suarez on target again. Yeah, the pass perfectly timed and so was the run Perfectly timed and so was the run That's a very good goal and much deserved the way the team are playing. Yeah, the stats don't lie, they've not got shots on target. No surprise that they've scored. It's a play on Madrid, half behind. Modric. Just lent the ball to his mate and got it back again. Carvajal. This could lead to a chance. It's good attacking play. That's good support as they build this attack. Bale. All about picking the right pass now as he cuts it back. Magnificent from the goalkeeper. It's all about positioning and spreading his body. Top class keeping. Well, time is ticking away. It's time for a change and here it comes. And the goalkeeper has done well to stop that one. They can be quick on the break now. Messi. Oh, he's through. That's great defending there, stopping that attack. And Ronaldo. Here's Isco. Well, it's an important area to win back the ball that. Good forward play from them. Lionel Messi. Into the middle from Messi. Good defensive clearance there. It's Isco. Well, this is fascinating. And the crowd are loving the drama that we're watching here. Just the one goal in it in favour of the home team. Yeah, careful that they don't start celebrating too quickly and that the players feel they've won the game before they actually have. Lionel Messi. Looked very good indeed, but the move has broken down. And here's Isco. Looked very good indeed, but the move has broken down. Bale. Bale trying the ball in behind. Just to keep it a beat. Surely the equaliser. Steered through. Messi's in. Now they've got a chance. And shoots! Well, they've all gone to the defender to say well done. But I think the guy who had the chance really should have scored. Well, he had the chance to get his shot away. Even though he had to take it quickly. Should have done better. Two more minutes to be played then. Added time. Running out of time. Still save themselves, but they're running out of opportunities. He's got his shot off now. Well, it has been coming, this equaliser. But it's taken them some time. Are we going to see a winner here? I think we might. And the goal looks spectacular and is very important. Yeah, there was some power behind that effort. I think the crossbar is still shaking. Well, here's the goal again. Well, I wonder where we go from here. Now that we're level again in the game. Anything could happen. And the referee has brought the regulation time to a close. With the team still level. Almost a 10 out of 10. Certainly a candidate for man of the match. He's not going to play the whole match though. And to be substituted here now. Yeah, he was involved in most things that were good here for his team. Top class. Messi! And Messi scores! Well, there aren't many people on this planet that can do what he's just done. He's tucked it away. Well out of the goalkeeper's reach. I'd love to see that. Don't have to whack it from that kind of position. Just side-footed home. They're in a good position here. In with a chance. Here's the shot. To get the equaliser. Trying to get in behind. Just a little too eagerly then. He could give the defender a yard, you know, and still get there. Well, there's nothing wrong with a pass. If he could have just stayed on side, he was through. There's some potential in this move. Messi! Lionel Messi! It's another goal! It's another goal! Well, he's doubled up here with his second goal. And he took it in excellent style, just like the first one. Prospect of even more goals. 4-2 is the score. Kovacic. Kovacic. I like the look of this attack. And now Iniesta. Lionel Messi. Marcelo. Ivan Rakitic, free kick, conceded by him. Messi! Messi! Messi! It's his goal. Bale. Carvajal. It's no goal. The flag's up. It was certainly a well-worked move, but denied by the assistant. On to the attack now. They're really working the opposition around with this passing. They can't get near it. No, they can't. They're having to do a lot of chasing. They're just wearing them out. He's won the ball in his own penalty area. He's got to deal with it now. But what a contest. In the first period of extra time. Second period to come. And it's down to the last 15 minutes now, as we go into the second half of extra time. Marcelo. They could pose some danger now. Could have halved the deficit there. No, that's when you need your front man to be nice and composed and to be clinical, and he just wasn't that from close in. Seji Roberto. The master at getting into positions where he can receive the ball is Iniesta. He just opens up his body to lay it off. And they've cut it out. Sergio Busquets. Suarez. On the move and able to cut out the pass. Modric. Modric. Benzema. Marcelo. Coming on strong and looking to play their way through now. And now the shot! Well, it looked a bad mess, but I think the defender just put him off. Yeah, he's got to take a lot of credit for that because he had to take the shot quickly, the lad who was trying to score. Ivan Rakitic. Neat interpassing from Barcelona. Hit it well! Fine save he's made there. And he's not let the ball escape his grasp. Referee has chosen to add on two extra minutes. Taken up by Benzema. Benzema! A big moment for Karim Benzema. Well, really, it has all fallen apart for them in extra time, but they've got this goal here, a last mark in a game that now has gone beyond them. Yeah, full marks to keep him plugging away. They could have easily just sat back, but they haven't. They've kept on going, but, yeah, too little too late, I think. Well, the defending hasn't been too good. You have to say that. It's finished now. It's finished. It's finished. It's finished. It's finished. It's finished. It's finished. It's finished now with the final whistle. It was a fine performance. They worked really well when they had the ball, which wasn't that often, but also they were very good when the opposition had the ball. Yeah, it just goes to show those possession stats can be deceiving. It's what you do with a ball, and they used it really well. Yeah. Well, there's the final whistle. Arsenal have won it. They've got all the rights of bragging around the town now by this victory over their neighbours. Yeah, they can go out shopping now. Rather than the losers who will be hiding at home, I think, for the next three days. FANS SHOUT OUT FANS SHOUT OUT FANS SHOUT OUT"}]}

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Martin Tyler and with me today, as always, is Allan Smith! Thank you, Martin. Looking forward to this one. Should be a good game. Today's game, Manchester United against Barcelona. Still very much the benchmark Barcelona, aren't they? For the style of football, little tweaks here and there, but very much a standard that these players have to rise to. Yes, I think that's fair. Tiki Taka, as it is known, that short-style passing game, they have amended it to a certain extent, and I think you've got to do that against certain sides. Manchester United have designed Old Trafford these days very much for the supporter, particularly those who perhaps only come occasionally, particularly for those who come in the week when there aren't matches. They have a wonderful tourist trail around it, and on the pitch it must be an amazing place to play. You can say that again, they do call it the theatre of dreams for a reason. So much has been won on this pitch by the home team and the away one. Guilherme Santoso is the ref. Manchester United getting the first half underway. And the cross is in. And no scraps for the attackers to feed on from the goalkeeper that time. Hung on to the ball well. Iniesta. Here's a chance to move forward from midfield after that interception. And the cross is in. And the cross is in. And the cross is in. And the cross is in. And the cross is in. And the cross is in. And the cross is in. Interception. Ivan Rakitic. They might open them up now. And they feel good about that. A really strong and clean tackle. Good position there from... Lukaku! Well read by the goalkeeper. They do hate being chipped, keepers, don't they? They do. And he did anticipate it and collected it comfortably in the end. Nemanja Matic. The shot's on! What a fine save. And that's a corner for Manchester United. FULL-TIME WHISTLE Chance for the cross. That should be a penalty. It is! FULL-TIME WHISTLE Oh, what a miss! Oh, the pressure has got to him big time. Kike. Luis Suarez. That's a good challenge. And here's the shot. Wonderful save. Had to really reach out for that. And that will end the threat at least for the moment. And he's moved in trying to jostle the opponent off his stride. And that's good support as they build this attack. They're grateful for that, to have an intervention like that and get back on the ball when they're defending so much. And now Iniesta. Pogba. FULL-TIME WHISTLE That's very good positional play. And he's read the situation perfectly with that interception. Shot's on! Great save by a diving goalkeeper. And that will be a corner for United. FULL-TIME WHISTLE Free kick here. FULL-TIME WHISTLE FULL-TIME WHISTLE It's what you do when you get the ball that really counts and they're trying to make the most of that turnover in play. And now Iniesta. He's looking for the cross. FULL-TIME WHISTLE And that's a corner, Barcelona's corner. FULL-TIME WHISTLE Well he lost it in the earlier challenge and now he's pinched the ball back. Pogba. FULL-TIME WHISTLE Well now they've won the ball back in the middle of the park by intercepting that pass. FULL-TIME WHISTLE On the attack here. It could be a chance! Decent block and the defender has dispossessed it. FULL-TIME WHISTLE Barcelona have yet to really make an impact on the game. Well no shots at all so far for Barcelona. Well you have to wonder, are we going to see a shot here before the game is out? The fans are absolutely furious. FULL-TIME WHISTLE This might be it! But in the way of that, blocked it well. Corner for Manchester United. FULL-TIME WHISTLE That's the way to win the ball back. And now Iniesta. Pogba. Mata. United's corner. FULL-TIME WHISTLE And he scores with the header! That is textbook from him. Well they've got power, they've got height. And when the corner is that accurate, only one end result. Let's see the replay now. FULL-TIME WHISTLE In front here are Manchester United. Nemanja Matic. He made the challenge, he made the block. Ivan Rakitic. The shot's on! Great stop. Ivan Rakitic. So it's 1-0 here as the half-time whistle goes. If at the start of the game you'd suggested a scenario at half-time like the one we've got, they'd be delighted, wouldn't they? I think so. I mean, the way they've passed the ball about... Well, there's going to be an alteration now, and with the team trailing, you can understand why he's going to make it. Pogba. Saw that pass coming in midfield, made the intervention, and now maybe he can push the team forward with his work on the ball. Quick header, found a teammate. Luis Suarez. Well, they're in a good position here. Nemanja Matic. Romelu Lukaku. Excellent play too. Loses marker. Very good stop here. He's got his shot off now, and he's put it in for the goal. That's top quality, no doubt about it. Well, that's all about anticipation and just snapping up the rebound. Different angle on it here. Restarting at 2-0. He's stumbled a bit there, but has managed to stay on his feet. Very good tackle. Lionel Messi. Looking down at that bench. Barcelona want to make a change now. Nemanja Matic. Romelu Lukaku. And they've got it away from the danger. Keeps it going. Another shot! Decent effort, just off target. Yeah, unlucky because he got some power behind the ball, just not the direction. Activity on the bench for the losing team. A substitute getting ready to come on. Samuel Umtiti. Nice return pass. Luis Suarez. Luis Suarez. Barcelona get the throw. Mata. Played down the wing, keeping the wide attack going. Lost his man. Take the chance with the shot there. Yeah, thought he might have done better there. Had a bit of time and space. Good position. Ivan Rakitic. Romelu Lukaku. Nemanja Matic. That's a good challenge. Adatoura. Now he's looking for support. He's crossed it well. He's got it away and that's what you have to do. Adatoura. Moving the opposition around with these two players. Mata. Mata. Well, they're back defending and they've cut the pass out there. And maybe that will ease the pressure. Samuel Umtiti. Jordi Alba. Looking for Lionel Messi. Good place to win the ball back there. Because the pressure was starting to mount. And the interception was timely to say the least. Jordi Alba. Can't keep the ball at the moment. He's got to cross to make that interception. He saw it coming. Antonio Valencia. Ivan Rakitic. And here's the shot. And the goalkeeper got a touch to that. Fine save. Jordi Alba. Sergi Roberto. Barcelona have got a chance here. The score! And he's put it into the bottom corner. There's new hope. They've cut it back to one. I thought this game was done and dusted. But anything but now. Oh, it's a great finish to take the keeper at the equation. I mean, the keeper had no chance there. Bottom corner. It's United's free kick. It's noticeable that the home supporters are trying to help the team in this situation. It could be in. That might have just had a big influence on the game. But they've dealt with it. And they can breathe again. Romelu Lukaku. He's got his shot off now. Useful block in those circumstances. And it's going to be his throw here. There's another angle coming up here, Alan. Wonderful contact on the ball there. Shot on here. You can see the wince on his face. Maybe the muscle's gone. And they've got their new man ready, Barcelona, to make the change. In midfield, they've got it back via an interception. Romelu Lukaku. Mata. Good width in the attack here. Looking for a cross at the end of it. A penalty! Well, well, well. Well, he's given a penalty. It's a yellow card, Alan. I think that's fair enough. From the ref, it was a clear foul. And it's a clear penalty. Coming into the match is Javier Mascherano. Mascherano clears here. 2-1 the final score, as the referee calls a halt. And that's the end of the game. 2-1, it's finished. Ready now to go into competitive action again, you would feel, having won this friendly. Yeah, they look just about ready to me. They look fit and they've settled into a system that they look comfortable with. It should bring the fire to a break. Thank you for playing."}]}

Swung in from the corner and the corner claimed by the goalkeeper, not too difficult. The referee has blown for half time at 1-1. Your view Alan Smith on Cristiano Ronaldo's first half. I would be happy with that first 45 minutes, it was a good goal from him, good overall performance actually. In on goal, Gareth Bale, aimed at Cristiano Ronaldo at the far post. Carrasco, into the box, punched away by the keeper. Back to Modric, shoots, good save. Atletico Madrid, start the second half. Griezmann, trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. Looked very good indeed, but the move was broken down. Now Casemiro, Benzema, now with Ronaldo. Sa\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdl, Griezmann, he wasn't fazed by facing a player who's already got the better of him in this game. Well he's got his defenders out of jail there because they allowed the striker to run free. Carvajal, looking for Isco, Gabi, Kevin Gameiro. Griezmann, gets his cross in. Modric, here's Casemiro. Real Madrid looking good with this attack. Needed to time that tackle well. It's cost a corner, could have been worse if he'd got it wrong. The manager's going to bring on a fresh player now. Corner played in, and they get it away. Marcelo. Carvajal. Here's Isco. Into the attacking third. Came in with a challenge and the ball broke free. Griezmann. Felipe Luis. It's a good cross. It's rather skewed off his head in the end. Yeah, he didn't catch it properly. I think he probably closed his eyes there. Just looking at the tactics of this match. Maybe the substitution will hold the key. Marcelo. Carvajal. Rafael Varad. Sergio Ramos. Now Casemiro. Modric. Karim Benzema. Good position, they've worked this attack very well. Flag has gone up, foot offside, tight. Out of the backup brigade. They're going to have a chance centre stage. Well, we're in the last knockings of the game, but we're still on the edge of our seats here. It's that close. Out to Cristiano Ronaldo in that wide area. Good play, but they've lost the ball now. The opposition could get at them. Kevin Guimero. Now Thomas. Excellent work on the attack. Atletico Madrid. Time for goal! Comfortable work, really. Bit of a stretch for the goalkeeper, but never looked as though he was going to be beaten. No, bread and butter really for this lad with his talent. Corner's taken. Body! Oh, just too high. Yeah, couldn't quite get over the ball, but decent effort. Return to Ronaldo. Played forward. A bit of menace in this attack. Good punch from the goalkeeper from the cross. Two more minutes to play. That have added time. Stopped him phatically and just as well. The approach play looked very encouraging. And the score's level. In on goal, Gareth Bale. Aimed at Cristiano Ronaldo at the far post. And it's in. And it's in. well the cross came over and a real need to get rid of the ball here now here's Arturo Vidal, now Jordi Alba this is Vidal the Blaugrana have given the ball away Dybala and here's Blaise Matuidi and here he is Mandzukic and on the basis of that effort quite clearly he's not wearing his shooting boots at the moment well it's a strong effort used his laces but screwed it well off target one minute remaining given away we've been waiting to find out now we know a minimum of three added minutes here Matuidi the object of the exercise from Juventus is to get it forward that's what they're doing that's all there is time for at the full time whistle and Barcelona with the lead going into the second leg of this time Wow Derek well it's not quite done and dusted you just have to imagine what those players are going through now with this league going into the second leg the final just around the corner can the coach keep the players feet on the find out very soon"}]}

We're both really looking forward to describing it for you. Well, Alan, today Chelsea representing, if you like, London and the south of England, Manchester United from the football capital, the northwest of England. It's a wonderful prospect. It is. We've seen some classic encounters between these two and it's been a bit of needle as well in the past. Well, we've got an interesting match up here. Eden Hazard against Romelu Lukaku. Well, Eden Hazard, he's got a great ability on the ball, the kind of ability that defenders hate to face. That's for Romelu Lukaku. He's one of the stronger players in this league and he uses that strength to really good effect. Here's the Chelsea line-up. Thibaut Courtois starts in goal. Gary Cahill starts alongside David Luiz in the heart of defence. Eden Hazard starts with Pedro in the wide positions. Marata is the sole striker today. This is then the Manchester United line-up. David De Gea starts in goal. Eric Bailly plays with Phil Jones in central defence. Paul Pogba plays with Nemanja Matic in centre midfield. Romelu Lukaku is the sole striker today. In my lifetime, Mal and the club, of course, has been rebuilt. Manchester United from the horror of the Munich air crash back in 1958 is a great credit to those at that time who got the club going again and the legacy that it's left and the style that's expected of this great club. Yeah, it's a time that nobody associated with this football club will ever forget. Bobby Charlton, Harry Gregg, Bill Foulkes, some famous names from that time. Now Mkhitaryan. It's a good place to win the ball here. Victor Moses. Promising build-up until that challenge. Valencia. Now Mkhitaryan. Getting forward well as a team now. He's very confident with the ball at his feet. Looked very good indeed, but the move has broken down. Conte. Angolo Conte. He's on the move all the time and makes lots of these interceptions. Oh, that's good defending. Pedro. Conte. Victor Moses. He's screened the ball well there. Good booking from the referee, just a free kick. Victor Moses. Under some pressure, he's shielded it well. He's better at winning the ball than using it, Angolo Conte, but here he comes. Goalkeeper can get the ball here for his goal kick. Now Jones. Now Mkhitaryan. Rashford. Impressive attacking play here from Manchester United. Good defending. Great interception. Lukaku. Now with Mkhitaryan. Still a chance in there off the goalkeeper. Anticipated the direction of the pass and was able to intervene. Lovely incisive pass. He's got his shot off now. Conte. Morata. Marcus Alonso. It was good play until they got that challenge in. Fogba. Nemanja Matic. Mata. Here's a chance to attack. Romelu Lukaku. He's cut that out well, well read. Chelsea have been the closest challengers in terms of Premier League trophies won to Manchester United. Of course, they're still a long, long way behind, but they are the current champions. Yeah, it is. It's a big game and it's getting bigger and bigger as the years pass for me. Intriguing contest this. Hazard. That's a serious situation and on he goes. Shots on him. No scraps for the attackers to feed off from the goalkeeper that time. Hung on to the ball well. Now Mkhitaryan. Nemanja Matic. Mata. Eric Bailly. Fogba. Good forward play from them. No nonsense defending from him. Going for goal. Oh, that would have looked great if it had flown in, but in the end it didn't fly very close at all. No, he looked a bit embarrassed after that effort. Frustration from the manager, but on the same token, his team are playing well. They might have gone ahead there, but they'll get another chance. Marcos Alonso. Contact. Trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. Good challenge. Fogba. Hendrik Mkhitaryan. Good work, really, to read the intention of the pass. Chelsea on a bit of a charge now, through midfield. Return ball. Pedro. Now it's Marcos Alonso. Hazard. Another shot. A goal kick. There's some potential in this move. Here's Conte. Romelu Lukaku. I don't know who the lad saw there, passing the ball. Somebody in the crowd, maybe. David Luiz. Two more minutes to be played, then, and in time. Marcos Alonso. And it's going to be an attacking move, this, from Chelsea. Hazard, this time, goes for the cross. Keeper's ball. He's read the intentions of the opposition, and we're halfway through, and we haven't yet got a goal to bring to you. 0-0 at half-time. But perhaps with Ed and Hazard, Alan, as the half-time whistle has gone, we can look back on that first half. It hasn't had quite the impact that we expected. He's got a shadow of his normal self out there. So unlike him, and hasn't had a chance hardly. Chelsea, to start this second half, then. Conte. Marcus Alonso. Morata. Giving the opposition a problem with their inter-passing. It's looking good, this move. They spread it out wide here. Chance to get some width into this attack. Good defending. And he heads it out for a throw-in. Antonio Valencia. Now Mkhitaryan. Lukaku. Played forward. A bit of menace in this attack. Here's Mata. At speed. Challenges for the ball. Pedro. Victor Moses. The Chelsea system gets players forward in the wide areas. It's working well for them. Neymar. Nemanja Matic. Klopper. Now Mkhitaryan. Well, this attack. Could have been a menace to it. Valencia crossing. And they scored that, the first goal of the game. He followed his instincts. He followed the play-in. And then he followed, watching the ball into the net. Nice and clean scoreboard. Just to make sure you follow shots in, that you're in that danger area. Antonio Conte. Not used to losing, really, in recent years. But he's got a bit of a knack for it. He's got a bit of a knack for it. He's got a bit of a knack for it. He's got a bit of a knack for it. He's got a bit of a knack for it. He's got a bit of a knack for it. He's got a bit of a knack for it. He's in that situation now and he's not happy. Manchester United in the lead. Cahill. Getting forward well as a team now. Pedro. Good challenge. Back it goes to David De Gea. Nemanja Matic. Now Mkhitaryan. Mata. Throw in here. Chelsea making a change now. That's it. Eric Bailly. Pogba. Really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now. Nice, cut that out. Well, well read. Thibaut Courtois. That's the ball from the back pass. Played down the wing. Keeping the wide attack going. Conte. N'Golo Conte. That's a combination of skill and will. In behind goes Fabregas. He can't keep it on the pitch. It's gone out for a throw. Now they're behind. They've got to try and switch things around. And here comes a substitution. Phil Jones. Henrik Mkhitaryan. Chelsea. A bit of a charge now. Through midfield. Nemanja Matic. Now Williams. Lovely incisive pass. Can pull it back here to set up a chance. Now Anthony Martial. He'll need to try and get the ball back now. He's got his tackle in. And the ball's gone out now. Nemanja Matic. Pogba. Valencia. Now he's looking for support. Marvellous tackle. Bracking his own talent here to keep the ball. And he has got some. Pau. Hazard. And they're still leading. And they've decided to go for the goal. And it's a goal. And they're still leading. And they've decided to go for a fresh player. In the hope of hanging on to that lead. Here's Mata. Now Bailly. Trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. And shoots! Good stop by the goalkeeper. That's very good shielding of the ball. He's aimed for the far post here. Not very easy for the goalkeeper there. Mata. Now with Lukaku. Pogba. Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Blind. Well they talk about football being a passing game. And you can keep it a very straightforward piece of goalkeeping as he catches the cross. Now Bailly. It's Daley Blind. Good vision. There's good progress with this attack. Mata the target in the centre. Tries to punch it away. Giving the opposition a problem with their inter-passing. Here's Fabregas. Trying to catch the other team out. Guided through. He's in! To bring them level. Spread the intentions of the opposition there to make the interception. Pogba. Maciel. A bit of space to go forward into with the ball. Hit in hard and low. The goal then for Manchester United. Well he's got a track record of that. On his left side he's so dangerous. But once he got his foot to it, Alan, it was always going to be a goal from that kind of cross. Yeah, he really did get a good connection with it, didn't he? And keep it no chance. Just widen the margin here to 2-0. Three minutes from the referee by the fourth official. That's the decision regarding added time. Conte. Now they've got a chance in this part of the pitch. Good defending. Now Mkhitaryan. And that is the end. It's all over. Well, very much on his game today. Romelu Lukaku. Oh, lots of energy. Lots of quality. A good goal, along with plenty of chances. He'll ask for the opposition and he didn't get himself on the score sheet, which he so often does, very few opportunities. Frustrating game in defeat for him. Valencia crossing. And they've scored, that's the first goal of the game. Matu, the target in the centre, tries to punch it away. Space to go forward into with the ball. Hitting hard and low. FULL-TIME WHISTLE"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a British football commentator. Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there everybody, Martin Tyler here along with Alan Smith, and our match today comes from the Premier League. Well it's Liverpool against Manchester United, if you're of a certain age you'll remember when Liverpool were top dogs in the 70s and 80s, and Alex Ferguson came down from Scotland to try and change that and he did, and Manchester United obviously in the last decade of the last century, the first decade of this century, he got what he wanted, but that rivalry still really exists. Yeah it does. And if you ask the players, and particularly the fans, they will say this derby is the one they look to at the start of every season. Manchester United have certainly improved defensively, and statistically they have the best defence in the league. It's a wonderful asset to have, isn't it, on the road, coming to a ground like this and to know that you really have got a good defence. When you played here Alan, did you touch that Anfield sign on the way out, or was that only for the home team? That is strictly only for the home team, Martin. This is the Liverpool side, Simon Mignolet starts in goal, Nathaniel Clyne starts with Alberto Moreno as the full-backs, Philippe Coutinho starts, looking to continue his great form in midfield, and today it's just the one striker in the side. This is then the Manchester United line-up, David De Gea starts in goal, Eric Bailly plays with Phil Jones in central defence, Paul Pogba plays with Emmanuel Matic in central midfield, Romelu Lukaku is the sole striker today. Can't talk about Liverpool to you without mentioning Anfield in 1989 and that glorious night for Arsenal. Well, back then, nobody tended to win at Anfield, I know it's not so easy to appreciate now, but it was a fortress, and they'll be hoping to get back to those kind of times. Pogba, Mata, guided through by Henrikh Mkhitaryan, just to keep the debate, and that's dealt with the problem, Wijnaldum, quick change of position here, Mata, Emmanuel Matic, now this looks promising, and they're keeping the ball, that's the important thing, he's got a chance to cross, Antonio Valencia, crossed in towards Rashford, comes out with a punch to clear the danger, it's a combination of skill and will to hold off the opposition, he can cut it back now, and that's a corner from Manchester United. He's put in the corner, well that will mean a corner coming up now, it's a terrific save from Simon Mignolet, we'll see it again, he's a master at getting his angles right, isn't he, this goalkeeper. Put the corner in the middle, Pogba, out for another corner. Mkhitaryan, swung it in, goes for it with a fist. He's taking a chance but he's keeping the ball under some pressure. Getting forward well as a team now, good screening and he's kept the ball. Mane, right from the kick-off, they look like scoring they have now. Sharp from the off and what a good goal. From close range, he took full advantage. It's a proper striker's goal that one, he gets just as much satisfaction out of that as a 20-yarder. Liverpool have the lead here. Down against Liverpool. Mata, Lukaku, and he's got the ball away from him with the tap. It was a good season, 14-15 for Manchester United, they did the league double over Liverpool. Although the game at Old Trafford, I mean, Liverpool actually played really well but they were beaten 3-0. Yeah, and that was actually the start of some good months, wasn't it, for Liverpool and the Brennan Rodgers before it tailed off towards the end of the season. Lukaku, off the post. Joel Matip. Lovren. Jordan Henderson. There's a dangerous feel to this attack, it's looking good from their point of view. They need to try and get the ball back now. Now Mkhitaryan. Wijnaldum. Coutinho. Now Sadio Mane, well read by the defender. Henry Mkhitaryan. Rashford. Nathaniel Clyne. Played back. Wijnaldum. On the attack here. The sprint could be on here for Wijnaldum. Henrik Mkhitaryan. They tried to keep it but they haven't been able to do that. Nathaniel Clyne. Henderson. Coming on strong. The shot's on! Two in front now. Well, keep the concentration and they've won this match I think. He can't have scored many better than this. With the bend he's imparted onto the ball. I'll give him credit, you can see exactly what he set out to do there. Executed it perfectly. I know this manager's been working hard on the training ground on a certain level. I know this manager's been working hard on the training ground on a certain level. And boy is he getting results out there. Just widened the margin here to 2-0. Mata. Jordan Henderson. Return pass. Advantage for Liverpool, can they take advantage of that decision? That's great defending there, stopping that attack. Now Marcus Rashford. Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Mata. Could be dangerous. Now Mkhitaryan. Mkhitaryan's target is in the middle there. Marena. Wijnaldum. Nathaniel Clyne. Very good forward thinking from Liverpool, always on the front foot. He's got to clear it now, promising build-up until that challenge. Lukaku. Three minutes to be added on. Roberto Firmino. Read the play well to intercept. Good defending. Doesn't want to get caught in possession here. Wijnaldum. Mohamed Salah. Mane. And that's in the back of the net. And it's there for Liverpool. Scoring in any game is worthy of celebration. When you get to, it is special. And he is feeling that special delight at the moment. Different angle on it here. Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Go on, Mane! Well, this is delightful football from Liverpool today. And the referee has signalled for half-time. 3-0 is the scoreline at this point. Only one team in it as we head for half-time. Only one team in it. The other team, they are struggling. Wildly different team talks, I think, from the managers. One's got an awful lot of work to do. The other one will be saying, Same again, please, lads. Crossed in towards Rashford. You don't often get a first half as one-sided as this one. They've been very good, the team that are leading, of course. That's caught the defenders out. It's a great run and a good pass. Lukaku with Rashford again. Looking to make an opportunity either for himself or a team-mate. Quick-witted and quick in his movement, too, to intercept there. Joel Matip. Moreno. Henderson. Wijnaldum. Nathaniel Clyne. Bit of space to go forward into with the ball. Crisp defending there. Rashford. Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Lukaku. And he's fouled by Dejan Lovren. Miller here for Lovren. Rash, Alan, reckless. When you attempt a slight tackle like that, you've got to time it perfectly, and he didn't. Manchester United want to make a change now. Very good distance to the clearance. Jordan Henderson. Roberto Firmino. They've got numbers in this attack, and it looks dangerous. Not a good challenge by the defender. Mane. And the ball's in. It's a goal. And that's the third, the hat-trick. It's a day he'll never forget. What a day he's having. Three goals now. He's been a thorn in the side of the opposition all match, and he thoroughly deserves that hat-trick. I think this manager was pessimistic coming into this game, and those fears are being realised now. His team trailing by a good margin. I have to say, it's so one-sided today, but all credit to the team that are racking up the goals. Jones. Trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. Well, we thought we were here for a very even contest, Alan, but it hasn't panned out that way at all. It hasn't. I mean, you look at the two sides, man for man, and there's not much to choose between them, but I think tactically, the team leading here has been a bit more cute. Lukaku. Wonderful save. Thank you very much. And it's a goal. It's a goal. It's a goal. It's a goal. Lukaku. Wonderful save. Had to really reach out for that. Substitution now for Liverpool. Got his head to it well, but no power. Well, to get there first, to find some space, but couldn't apply the finishing touch. That is a cheap piece of play to give the ball away like that. I think he saw the look from the other player and saw where the pass was going and read it. Anticipated the direction of the pass and was able to intervene. Roberto Firmino. On to the attack now. Into the box it goes. Along the ground. Now Mkhitaryan. Jordan Henderson. He must have some sixth sense to anticipate where that pass was going. He looked in, but he's diffused the danger. Liverpool are going to make an alteration to their line-up from the bench. Goal. Nathaniel Clyne. Coutinho. Coming on strong and looking to play their way through now. It's Dele Blind. Now Anthony Martial. Taking on the defenders. Shots on him. I'll give him credit for having a go, but it was nowhere near the target. Yeah, he took responsibility, didn't he? And he'll be hoping it's a bit better next time. Jones. Now Anthony Martial. It's Mane. Quick passing from Liverpool to open up the opposition if they can. And in he goes with the tackle. Valencia. That's cut out. Sturridge. Sturridge. Mata. Antonio Valencia. And Herrera. It's Dele Blind. Well, this attack could have been a menace to it. Now Anthony Martial. Lukaku. And Herrera. Mata. Still on the attack and they've got a corner. And in it goes, but he's got his fist to it. It looks like being one of those games where the Liverpool keeper is not going to get beaten. Trying to get the cross in, nearest defender blocked it. Good screening and he's kept the ball. Good forward play from them. He points to the spot, penalty. Penalty given, but no extra punishment for the culprit. Yeah, I think that's fair enough. I mean, it was a foul, but he's not denied an obvious goal scoring opportunity there. Well, you run the risk when you go to ground like that with a slide tackle of getting into serious trouble. Alright, it's a definite foul, Martin. It's a slide tackle, but he just mistimed it badly. And puts away the penalty. No worry about the pressure or the responsibility here, and there's the goal. Yeah, I think some people are cut out for it, some aren't, and this lad certainly is. 4-1 is the scoreline. Most defenders will be furious with that because they were seeing the game out quite comfortably it seemed, but a little bit of loss of concentration and they've lost the goal. Yeah, maybe you can understand it. It's been so easy for them out there that they've taken the foot off the gas. He's spotting it up now to take the corner. Excellent performance from the team. The supporters know that the job is pretty much done and they're just loving it. I don't think we'll get them out of the ground at the end. Well, they've been treated to some really good football, haven't they? Some good goals and we're appreciative of that. Very good distance to the clearance. Could be dangerous. Well, it was a foul and he's given the free kick. Coutinho. Wonderful chance. Up for grabs here. Emre Can. This could lead to a chance. It's good attacking play. Makes a challenge here. And Herrera. Eric Bailly. And that is the end. It's all over. It was absolutely extraordinary, exceptional, elegant, excellent. Well, he goes across and grabs the match ball from the ref. A hat trick and that's to be treasured by any player. Good screening and he's kept the ball. Mane. Henderson. Coming on strong. Shots on. Two in front now. Well, keep the concentration and they've won this match, I think. Mane. And that's in the back of the net. And it's there for Liverpool. Numbers in this. Not a good challenge by the defender. Mane. And puts away the penalty."}]}

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "La Liga is the competition that we're featuring in our match today. I'm Martin Tyler. Hello to you all. Alan Smith is with me. It's Espanyol in this match today against Barcelona. It's still very much the benchmark Barcelona, aren't they, for the style of football, and little tweaks here and there, but very much a standard that these players have to rise to. Yes, I think that's fair. Tiki Taka has his nose in it. They have amended it to a certain extent. I think you've got to do that against certain sides. Here's the team list for Espanyol. Barcelona's line-up here. Marc-Andr\u00e9 Testegen starts in goal. Samuel Umtiti plays with Piqu\u00e9 in central defence. Iniesta plays with Paulinho in central midfield. And attack Lionel Messi partners up front with Luis Suarez. Valente, Lara Zabal, ready to get the game underway. The referee's got to manage this match and giving the foul I think is quite a good thing to do. Umtiti coming on strong, looking to play their way through now. Now Messi. Rakitic. Defended well. Victor Sanchez. Got the ball and they're going at the opposition with speed. Guiding it through the defenders. There's space to try and hit it now. Well they've broken through here with a really good goal. And the celebrations reflect that. The supporters are going crazy. It's a terrific moment for the team. He looked the goalkeeper in the eyes and said, right, I've got the win here and he's got the goal to show that. I love that kind of finish when you don't have to blast it as long as the placement is right. So the first goal, it's 1-0. Pique. And now Iniesta. Meet interpassing from Barcelona. Shots on him. Got in the way. And they've got a corner out of that. A bit lucky, it was deflected. Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Played in by Messi. All penalty given for Barcelona. Did you see anything cynical in that, Alan? Didn't look comfortable going into it and it was a definite foul. Penalty put away. He's one of the lads who really wants to take on this responsibility and it showed. Probably the last man you want to face from a penalty is Lionel Messi and you can see why. So, away we go at one all. Raniero. I like the look of this attack. Challenges for the ball. Now Messi. Suarez. Great tackle. Suarez. Great tackle. Good place to win the ball here. Iniesta. Suarez. Now with Messi. Luis Suarez! It was a real opportunity but there might be a key moment in there from a defensive point of view. Yeah, well, they really did converge on him quickly. He didn't miss by much but he's missed it. Goal! Victor Sanchez. Pique. Coutinho. It's Messi. It's good movement forward here. Paulinho. Coutinho. Now it's Suarez. He can put them in front. Into the lane here. What a big goal that might turn out to be. Two for him on the day. And two very well taken goals. Well, they'll want to see this again, this goal. Good news for Barcelona, they lead. These two have got a great understanding with their passing. Ivan Rakitic. Luis Suarez. Good position, they've worked this attack very well. Shots on! Suarez! He's blocked the shot well. Oh, it's a corner. That deflection. Gone short with the corner. Coutinho crossing it now. Put away, but not out of harm's way. On the attack here. Real chance. Espanyol have a corner now. And their chance to draw level in the match. Corner played it. Baptista! and now Iniesta, Coutinho, Messi, gets his foot in there. It's a good game this because Barcelona aren't having it all their own way, although they do lead. It's quite an even contest, half-time approaching. Raniero, good screening and he's kept the ball. Camion strong and looking to play their way through now. Coutinho. Lionel Messi. Excellent work with the tackle. The shot's on. And the goalkeeper reached for it but he didn't have to reach a full stretch. Made a bit of a meal of it there. Put the corner in the middle and they get it away. Lionel Messi. It's Messi. And Barcelona on the attack. And shoots! Great goalkeeper, great save. Well he shouldn't have had a pair there but he's so agile this keeper. Trying to catch the opposition out with a short corner. Suarez. Coutinho. With Rakitic. He's cut it back looking for a teammate. Gone behind for a Barcelona corner. A short corner. Rakitic. Shot's on here. And they have scored. And they do lead now by two. And they've worked very hard for this. It should get them across the line at the end of the match. We'll see. It is certainly the kind of match that we thought we were coming here to see. With the better team playing the better football. Yeah and they've handled that expectation haven't they in terms of being strong favourites. So fair play to them for that. Fair play to them for that. Just a reminder 3-1 it is now for Scola. Duarte. And the referee blows for half time. The teams go in at 3-1. And what about Messi's first half Alan? On top of his game out there. And I'm sure he'll be thinking about grabbing his hat trick in the second half. It's the start now of the second half. Moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here. He's cut that out. Well well read. Striving forward purposefully. Could get his cross in now. Looking for Iniesta. Cleared. Cleared away by the defender. Iniesta. Paulinho. And they couldn't quite find Messi. Iniesta. Back into midfield for the moment for Messi. Suarez. With Iniesta again. Promising build up. Until that challenge. Baptistao. Moving the opposition around with these two players. Now here's a chance to get at the opposition. That's passed by everyone. But one very nearly got on the end of it. Well that's good defending. And that will be a throw. And the man coming off is Iniesta. Leo Baptistao. He's aimed it in towards a decent fist away by the keeper. Very good distance to the clipper. Very good distance to the clearance. Lionel Messi. Now Messi. They could pose some danger now. Looking for Coutinho in the centre. And he keeps possession with that header. Coming on strong. And looking to play their way through now. And here's the shot. And he scores. Three of the best. He's made them play. And that completes a wonderful hat-trick. Well maybe that's the one he'll treasure the most because it's given him the hat-trick. Yeah, and he'll be taking home that match ball with a great deal of pride. Well it's a goal worth replaying over and over again, isn't it? I think the manager has decided he wants to let the player have a great individual reception which he wouldn't get at the final whistle. He's getting an ovation now as the substitution is made. Yeah, and well deserved too. A strong contender for man of the match. I have to say it's so one-sided today but all credit to the team that are racking up the goals. A return ball. Lionel Messi. Lopez. Lionel Messi. Played forward. A bit of menace in this attack. They spread it out wide here. A chance to get some width into this attack. Sergio Roberto. Messi. Ivan Rakitic. Jordi Alba. Sergio Busquets. Coutinho. And he gives it back to him. Denis Suarez. Possession given away once more. And it's in. And it's in. Possession given away once more. Luis Suarez. Denis Suarez. Well this attack has got a bit of menace to it. Now still one of the great teams to watch, Barcelona. And they're evolving. They have a great supply line of young players when you think maybe the golden generation are going to have to be... Saved by Andre Ter Stegen. Really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now. And shoots! Coming up now a corner. The ball's just deflected behind for that. And there's going to be some activity from the bench for Barcelona. Swung in from the corner. Jordi Alba really trying to use the full width of the pitch here. To make some progress. Rakitic! Oh, it's in there! They haven't switched off, Alan, late in the game. They've got another one, extended the lead. Oh, not letting up at all. Showing their ruthless side. Fair play to them. And here is another angle on that goal. Well, we're in the last few minutes now. And the die has been cast in this game, really. Nothing so far in this game to surprise us. Perhaps only the margin that they lead by. Yeah, it's not always easy coming into a game and everyone's expecting you to get a hatful, but they've kept their focus this side and taken the chances nicely when they've cropped up. Making sure there's no turnover. He's read that, hasn't he? And made the interception, made it look easy, actually. A break, maybe, from Barcelona. That's a good idea with the pass. Well, that should be a penalty. It is! Well, sometimes we talk about the double whammy, but it's a single whammy here. It's just a penalty. Yeah, the player concerned looked a little relieved. I think he thought he was going to see yellow there. BARCELIA TO SCANDILAR Oh, he's saved it! What? He's guessed the right way and two strong hands to the ball! Brilliant! Well, the game has run its course, here, and there's the final whistle. So, Leo Messi, your verdict, Alan Smith. Well, he goes across and grabs the match ball from the ref, a hat-trick, and that's to be treasured by any player. Well, they're going to really remember this for a long time, the winners in a derby, because of the margin. It's almost historic. It is, and humiliating for the losing side, here. Makes it worse, so much worse, that it's the derby match, and they're going to take some time to live this one down."}]}

Well, this is a matchup between two international teams today. The disadvantage, Alan, is that they don't play together very often. The positive, of course, is they are the country's very best players. They are indeed, and we have got some quality players to enjoy out there today, but, as you say, not all of them have played together too often, so there might be a slight lack of understanding at times. Number 23, Adrian Silva. Number 10, Mario. And number 7, Cristiano Ronaldo. CHEERING WHISTLE BLOWS This is the line-up for the home side. Alan, he's going to defend with six, isn't he? He's going to have those two holding midfield players and let the other four go and attack when they can. And the two lads in the middle, the two midfielders, are naturally defensive-minded players, Martin, so I don't think they'll naturally get forward too willingly. So, yeah, it looks a fairly cautious line-up, if you look at it. This is the line-up for the away side. Sergio Romero plays in goal. Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi plays with Javier Mascherano as the centre-backs. Evo Banega plays alongside Lucas Pilla in the middle of the park. Mauro Icari is the sole striker today. WHISTLE BLOWS It's Portugal to kick off. Acosta. Evo Banega. Pilla. Messi. Icari. What a chance for Messi. WHISTLE BLOWS There's some potential in this move. Eliseo. That's good support play from his team-mates. And now Messi. Evo Banega. Lionel Messi. Pilla. WHISTLE BLOWS Pilla. An attack from Argentina. Federico Fazio. Evo Banega. Pilla. Still passing, not really making inroads. Pilla. Messi. Icari. Pulls it back now. They've got the ball back, the interceptor got it for them. Di Maria. Trying to pick out Messi. Defended well. Now Adrian Silva. Here's Cristiano Ronaldo. Portugal attacking now. Typical Ronaldo, he wants to take them on. You don't want to see Cristiano Ronaldo coming at you like that. Di Mario. To put them in front. Up for grabs here. That's very good shielding of the ball. Ronaldo Silva. In with a chance. He's knocked it in. And they've got the lead now. It hasn't come easily. But they're delighted with it. It was a well-crafted move. And a fine finish at the end of it. Well, it's ended up in the back of the net, quite high up too. I'm not sure whether we actually meant it just to go under the bar. Maybe we'll find out afterwards. Real pleasure for Portugal. They've got this lead. Javier Mascherano. Filipe. Federico Fazio. Attacking now. Far too close. The cross. Headed down to a teammate. Filipe. Icardi. Trying to slip it through. The equaliser here. Comes out of the goalkeeper. Pepe's clearance. And it's in. And it's in. And it's in. And it's in. And it's in. And it's in. Now to play for a throw. Cedric. Bernardo Silva. I must say that here we've got a free kick given by the referee. Vilja. Mataro Acosta. Clever ball. In on the goalkeeper. He's got his shot off now. The shot gets blocked. He saw the look from the other player and saw where the pass was going and read it. Ewa Banega. Played forward. A bit of menace in this attack. Going for goal. Great goalkeeper. Great save. Well, he shouldn't have had a play there, but he's so agile, this keeper. Tanega. Icardi. Well, it is an equaliser that looked on the cards, I must say. As the game went on, you just wondered whether they would get frustrated. But now they're in a position, having equalised, to go on and try and win it. Fantastic from the neutral point of view that the game is level again. A good look here, again, by the replay of the goal. So, away we go at 1-1. Now Adrian Silva. So here we are at half-time and it's 1-1. Well, the player that we're featuring here has done well. He's certainly been an influence on this first half. Well, a really good late equalising goal and that might just change the manager's team talk now. At the kick-off, it's Argentina for the start of the second half. Eva Banega. Filha. And here's some attacking play from Argentina. Icardi. Lucas Biglia. Federico Fazio. A threat at the moment, but they have got the ball and that, I suppose, is a threat. Essic. He has to be very quick. Very quick. William Cavalho. Here's Cristiano Ronaldo. Portugal attacking now. Not a good challenge by the defender. In a great position to pull it back. Back into power for Cosper. Cedric. He's cut that out well. Well read. They can be quick on the break now. Icardi. Villa, Eva Banega, Messi, Icardi, Di Maria. Corner given to Argentina. Corner played into the middle. Well they just can't get the ball away, it's another corner. Let's have another glance at that save. Oh, that is wonderful stuff. And it's taken. Very close in, Alan, but not very close to scoring. Yeah, a simple save in the end and it should have been anything but. He should have been picking it out of the net, the keeper. Here's Joao Mario. Di Maria. Di Maria. And the attack coming from Portugal. Ronaldo. That'll be a corner. It's going to be a change for Portugal. Corner's taken. Disappointed that that didn't lead to more. And that's into the gloves of the goalkeeper. Not the hardest thing he'll have to do today by any means. Villa. Acosta. Trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. Promising build-up until that challenge. Here's Cristiano Ronaldo. And they've cut it out. Lionel Messi. Lucas Biglia. Now with Messi. The shot's on! And the goalkeeper has done well to stop that one. Sanction on the Portugal bench with a substitute. It's Messi's corner. Cleared away by the defender. And that's good support as they build this attack. And the referee has given the free kick. And it's a free kick. And it's a free kick. And it's a free kick. And it's a free kick. And it's a free kick. It's Bernardo Silva. Now Danilo. Now here's a chance to get at the opposition. Martinho with good vision. Dybala. The opposition are pressing high up the pitch, but they're keeping the ball. They've got enough numbers back. Biglia. Supporting player alongside. Panega. Mauro Icardi. Messi. He's gone! And he could well have won the game for them. Great moment. It is a decisive moment in the match, you feel sure. And here he was, faced by the goalkeeper. That was the challenge. In you go. Easy as you like. It looks easy, doesn't it? But I can tell you it's not. You have to be at the top of your game to try and to convert it. Well, a very exciting climax to an exciting game. This could be the decider. Well, it could be at this stage of the match. There doesn't seem much of an opportunity to come back. It could be decisive. And it's going to be a minimum of three minutes to be played of added time. Excellent play to attack at this late stage. They haven't given up yet. Final whistle. Pleased to win the match, I guess, because that's what you do whenever you play. But as a friendly game, more than just a result, Alan, for them. I think so. They'll take a lot of heart from that, because not only did they win, but they played well along the way. So, Leo Messi, your verdict, Alan Smith? Well, he had a good performance and snatched that late goal to grab the win. And there's going to be some activity from the bench for Barcelona. Swung in from the corner. Jordi Alba really trying to use the full width of the pitch here. To make some progress. Rakitic! Oh, it's in there! They haven't switched off, Alan, late in the game. They've got another one, extended the lead. Oh, not letting up at all. Showing their ruthless side. Fair play to them. And here is another angle on that goal. Well, we're in the last few minutes now. And the die has been cast in this game, really. Nothing so far in this game to surprise us. Perhaps only the margin that they lead by. Yeah, it's not always easy coming into a game and everyone's expecting you to get a hatful, but they've kept their focus this side and taken the chances nicely when they've cropped up. Making sure there's no turnover. He's read that, hasn't he? And made the interception, made it look easy, actually. A break, maybe, from Barcelona. That's a good idea with the pass. Well, that should be a penalty. It is! Well, sometimes we talk about the double whammy, but it's a single whammy here. It's just a penalty. Yeah, the player concerned looked a little relieved. I think he thought he was going to see yellow there. Warning. Oh, he's saved it! Well, he's guessed the right way and two strong hands to the ball, brilliant. Well, the game has run its course here and there's the final whistle. So, Leo Messi, your verdict to Alan Smith? Well, he goes across and grabs the match ball from the ref, a hat-trick, and that's to be treasured by any player. Well, they're going to really remember this for a long time, the winners in a derby, because of the margin. It's almost historic. It is, and humiliating for the losing side here. Makes it worse, so much worse that it's the derby match and they're going to take some time to live this one down."}]}

Yeah, it's a bit of a strange situation for English fans, at least, who can't get their heads round sharing grounds, but these two sets of supporters have, and looking forward to a good clash here. This is the Milan line-up. Gianluigi Donnarumma is the goalkeeper. Giacomo Bonaventura starts alongside Lucas Billet in the middle of the park. And they just go with the one-striker up front. This is Inter's line-up. Miranda starts with Andrea Ranocchia as the full-backs. Mauro Icardi is the sole striker today. Intercepted. Referee says advantage to Inter. He's got his shot off now. The goalkeeper is not really in trouble, easy say. Yeah. A little piece of interplay between the two. Borja Valero. Now, this should be a very interesting match. Milan will be looking to win the game. It's going to be tough for them. Perisic. Well, the tackle there has led to a throw. Borja Valero. Possession changes feet. Here is Rodriguez. Goes out wide again. Villa. Conte. Comes out with a punch to clear the danger. Inter's big leap. Ricardo Rodriguez. Promising build-up until that challenge. Perisic. Proper tackle, that. Buonaventura. Mia. Buonaventura. Mia. Spotted well by the defender, cut it out. Looking for Perisic. And here they are, on the attack. Now, Jean-Marie. Perisic. He's gone too early, he's offside. Leonardo Vinucci. Conte. Here's Sousa. There's good progress with this attack. There's going to be a throw-in after that tackle. Spread the intentions of the opposition there to make the interception. The build-up looked good there until the interception. Sousa. Perisic. Anticipated the direction of the pass and was able to intervene. Villa. Conte. Attacking play from Villa. Opportunity here. And it is the opening goal of this match. Oh, the fans are loving that one. It took a chance to get in there. And the ball just fell perfectly for him. Couldn't miss it there. No, he couldn't. You have got to be in the position technically to miss them. The offside goes through. So it's Milan with the lead. Inter now looking for some attacking inspiration. Good into the middle. A little bit crude there. He's given it. Penalty. Oh, I think he's got it spot on too. Definite foul. He's done the job. He's the specialist. It's a pretty good penalty with the pressure on. Yeah, I think some people have cut out some arm. This lad certainly is. The goal, wherever you look at it, it was very well taken. It is a level. Both sides are scored here now. He's good at cutting those passes out in the middle of the park. And they're moving forward now with real danger. Inter. Defender has to be quick. It was good play until they got that challenge in. He's very quick. He's had a go. Well, nowhere near. It was a long way out. Yeah, I think that's a waste to try his luck from there. Well, he was writing his own headlines in his own mind, I think, when he let fly. It would have been a worldy that. He's capable of it, but not tonight. Well, everything to play for in the second half. We've reached halftime at 1-1. Second halftime at San Siro tonight. Now they've got a chance in this part of the pitch. Good defending. Now, Joe Manning. That's a tremendous piece of play. This could be a chance. He's in the clear. Well, he was in the right place at the right time to cut it out. He's had a go. A couple of options for him from the free kick. Whether to go for goal or put it to where his teammates are lining up. Hit it well. Well hit in the free kick. Fabulous save. Yeah, his defenders looking behind him and they're thankful for what he's a top class keeper here. It's not easy, is it, when you're behind that wall? You can't always see it, but fine handling by the keeper. Swung in from the corner. That's good defending. Come away with the ball cleanly. Great tackle. Icardi. Got the opportunity. Well, let's have another look at that because it was a very, very tight call. They were in otherwise. When I saw it first time of asking, I thought he was on, you know. But looking at the replay, what a good decision from the linesman that was. Milan have substitutions in mind. Conte. Nice return pass. Sosa. 3-0, Liverpool! Buonaventura Now they're looking to get forward from this position Good position, they've worked this attack very well Icardi, into the lane here What a big goal that might turn out to be He took it with great aplomb, I'm sure getting the first goal gave him confidence to grab the second chance here The goal, wherever you look at it, it was very well taken Milan are losing right now Piliac Piliac Antonio Candreva He's got the ball away from him with the tackle Buonaventura Going forward well In with the chance He's put it away beautifully Oh, this is end-to-end stuff, isn't it? I hope we're in for a bit more of the same Well, the equaliser has happened Took perhaps the opposition by surprise But we're level again It's what they deserved And that's a goal well worth analysing again Two teams brilliantly matched in this contest It's level again A bit witted and quick in his movement too to intercept there Buonaventura Good work really to read the intention of the pass It was good progress with this attack A corner to come because of that deflection Piliac Taken by Sousa Here's Sousa A chance to break away now on the counter Still countering here Mojavele To Xhau Mario He could pose some danger now And here's a chance Xhau Mario Mojavele He went in well Completely intercepted Oh, I'm saying he's made that He's not let the ball escape his grasp Played down the wing Keeping the wide attack going Xhau Mario Antonio Candreva Now they've got a chance in this part of the pitch Milan still looking for that piece of magic that still could give them the lead Space to cross the ball now The intentions of the opposition there to make the interception Chance to go at the opposition with pace Piliac Piliac Buonaventura Able to make a good interception Now Xhau Mario Played forward, a bit of menace in this attack Antonio Candreva Can it? Rotavic Delivered it to the box Many keep possession with that header Good block Piliac Time ticking away There is the final whistle The team still level here after 90 minutes The coaches have had their say Both teams back on their feet They were looking rather tired as we waited for extra time which now begins What we get to see of course the assistants don't whether that will change down the years I'm not sure but anyway the replay here shows he's got it right He has I mean there was no real goal scoring chance but effectively pleased that New organisation 41 Piliac Rotavic Well read by the goalkeeper They do hate being chipped keepers don't they? They do They do and he did anticipate it and collected it comfortably in the end Now to play for a try Still got a bit to do but this is promising Strong fair challenge pulls out for a throw though Leonardo Panucci Here's Sousa Borja Valero Here's Icardi Slipping it through He saw the look from the other player and saw where the pass was going and read it Miak This could lead to a chance It's good attacking play It's good play until they got that challenge in Able to cut that out with some sharp movement Only two more minutes to be added on by the referee now There's a dangerous feel to this attack It's looking good from their point of view That's the keeper's ball from the moment the cross left his foot Well there's another 15 minutes to come the second half of extra time 15 minutes left of extra time as we start the second half of the extra period Miak Really getting into a position this far up the pitch now That's great defending there stopping that attack This turnover could be costly against a side that can break like this Strong challenge Delia That's a bit of interplay between these two He's very confident with the ball at his feet He's had a go here Corner Corner lap Well that's the end of his game and what a game he's had and the crowd appreciate that Excellent Well he was so lively from the first whistle Delia and he was dictating the match for large parts Well done son Abate Anticipated the direction of the pass and was able to intervene Borja Valero He's looking good this move It's a nice bit of skill but the defending well it was woeful Sosa Sosa Sosa Sosa Sosa Sosa Sosa Sosa Sosa Sosa Sosa Lian Leonardo Panucci Time against Inter Two more minutes to play of added time Here they come again Another attack in the closing stages and into the net by the post Just touched it off the post, goalkeeper absolutely beaten.

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello everyone, Martin Tyler here, Alan Smith with me as usual. Big welcome to you to today's game. The game today, Liverpool against Barcelona. So much success in this stadium and field for Liverpool Football Club in the 70s and 80s. It's still regarded as a mecca for many visitors from all around the world. Yeah, I remember visiting it in 1989. That was a good night. I'm a bit disappointed you haven't mentioned that, Martin. I'm sure opposition coaches, when Messi's on the pitch as he is here, say we'll show him onto his right foot. But it doesn't work, does it? No, easier said than done. He's a little genius and I'd expect him to take this game by the scruff of the neck. Can't talk about Liverpool to you without mentioning Anfield in 1989 and that glorious night for Arsenal. Back then, nobody tended to win at Anfield. I know it's not so easy to appreciate now. But it was a fortress and they'll be hoping to get back to those kind of times. This is the Liverpool side. Simon Mignolet starts in goal. John Matip starts with Dejan Lovren as the centre-backs. Sadio Mane starts with Mohamed Salah in the wide positions. And just one out-and-out attacker in the line-up. Barcelona's line-up here. Marc-Andre Testegen starts in goal. Samuel Umtiti plays with Jared Pique in central defence. Iniesta plays with Ivan Rakitic in midfield. Luis Suarez is the lone striker today. Barcelona have got the game underway. Good vision from Suarez. Barcelona moving smartly here. Wijnaldum. It goes out wide again. It's come off the goal. Jotso! Right from the kick-off. It looked like scoring they have now. Sharp from the off. And what a good goal. That was an amazing shot. Very difficult technique. And the goalkeeper left helpless. Well, he's rooted to the spot. He flew past him at some pace. Liverpool have taken the lead. Ivan Rakitic. Samuel Umtiti. And it's in. And it's in. And it's in. And it's in. And it's in. And it's in. Ivan Rakitic. Samuel Umtiti. Luis Suarez. Lovren. Roberto Firmino. Jorginho. Wijnaldum. Now it's offside. Sergio Busquets. Now to play for a throw. Lionel Messi. Luis Suarez. And Barcelona on the attack. Promising build-up until that challenge. Nathaniel Clyne. Now it goes into the wider areas where they've got a winger waiting. And now he's looking for some support. Got to be. And that's in the back of the net. And it's there for Liverpool. Well, they call it his weaker side. Not too weak that. No, he did it, Martin. He took a little chance there. And he's only been rewarded for it. Well, let's take another look at the goal. Oh, he's loving it. The manager. He's seen his team playing really well. Just what he was asking for. Restarting at 2-0. Ivan Rakitic. Samuel Umtiti. Now Sadio Mane. Coutinho. Deep defending here, but he's got the ball. Dele Feu. Sergio Busquets. It's Mane. They've got numbers in this attack. And it looks dangerous. And out wide they were in a good position until that defender acted very promptly and decisively. Couldn't keep it in play. It's gone out for a throw. Pique. Ivan Rakitic. Luis Suarez. Strong challenge. Nathaniel Clyne. Jordan Henderson. Marena. Coutinho. It's a real shine to Liverpool's play in these kinds of attacks. Now Alberto Marena. Now, can he take them on? He's got his shot off now. Threw everything behind that shot. Frustrated that it wasn't quite on target. Well, if he keeps getting in those kind of areas, I'm sure he'll score pretty soon. Gerrard Dele Feu. Gerrard Dele Feu. Meet interpassing from Barcelona. Jordi Alba. Suarez. Dele Feu. And he's in. An opportunity to help their chances now. Just a smooth operator, the Croatian midfield man who likes to get forward and shows the value of it once again. Well, for a fraction of a second, Alan, I thought he was going to keep it out. He did get a touch on the ball, the goalkeeper. But in it went. Yeah, he's annoyed with himself there. He's his own harshest critic and he feels he should have done better. Off we go again. 2-1. Number four, Ivan Rakita. Nathaniel Clyne. Wijnaldum. Good position. They've worked this attack very well into quite a dangerous position now. It's Messi. Sergio Busquets. Now Messi. Challenges for the ball. Jordan Henderson. Wijnaldum. Nathaniel Clyne. Still passing, not really making in-road. Firmino! Liverpool have won a corner. Coutinho plays the ball in, nodded back into the middle, goal kick to come. Sergio Busquets, and now Iniesta, a break maybe from Barcelona, to level it up now. Oh, what a miss. Well, what a chance for an equaliser that was. I think the tension got to him, tightened up. Henderson. Roberto Firmino. It's Mane, darting infield now. Great work by the goalkeeper. The ball is his and he's made sure he's protected it. Jordi Alba. Sergio Busquets. Luis Suarez. And it's now with Liverpool. Coutinho. It's in. In off the post. Talk about precision. We see it again, how close it was to maybe hitting the post and staying out. But luck was with him. In it goes, it counts. Great. The goalkeeper thought he'd got his angles covered there, but he didn't look too pleased when it rebounded in. Well, it's great when a plan comes together and the manager doubly delighted with the way his team are playing. Just a reminder, 3-1 it is now for Scola. Ivan Rakitic. And now Iniesta. Luis Suarez. It's good play until they got that challenge in. Coutinho. Well, that's half time and 3-1 is the score at the break. Coutinho has been outstanding in this first half. I would be happy with that first 45 minutes. It was a good goal from him. Good overall performance, actually. Can Liverpool replicate a good first half in the second period which is now underway? Mohamed Salah. Coming on strong and looking to play their way through now. He's had a go here. That's a brilliant goal. Well, he's not far out, but you've got to be on your toes in these circumstances. And he was. He took it with greater plumb. I'm sure getting the first goal gave him the confidence to grab the second chance here. Another angle on it here. But all credit to the team that are racking up the goals. Samuel Umtiti. Coutinho. Wijnaldum. Played down the wing, keeping the wide attack going. He'll need to try and get the ball back now. Sergio Busquets. Ivan Rakitic. Luis Suarez. It's Messi. Joel Matip. There's a lot of pre-match talk between the two managers. One has got his team absolutely right and has the goals to show for it. And the other hasn't. No, I mean, the winning manager, if he does win, he'll claim a tactical masterclass here, I think, the way he's overcome the opposition. And up went the flag. Offside given. Free kick. Sergio Roberto. Sergio Busquets. Luis Suarez. Lovely football. Typical Barcelona. Henderson. Jordan Henderson. He's beaten his man. Shot's on here. Better this time from the keeper. Well, he's kept going, hasn't he? He's kept his head off and maybe that'll be the turn in terms of his form out here. Jordan Henderson. And now Iniesta. Good work, really, to read the intention of the pass. Wijnaldum. Nathaniel Clyne. Gerard De Lefeu. Ivan Rakitic. Luis Suarez. Well, they're in a good position here. The defender really putting his body on the line to stop the cross. It's Mane. Now this is an interesting attack. Coutinho. He's got his shot off now. Well, he's doubled up here with his second goal. And he took it in excellent style, just like the first one. You can see a slightly different viewpoint on it. Well, I know this manager's been working hard on the training ground on a certain shape and, boy, is he getting results out there. One team really on their game today. The other very off colour. Luis Suarez. Ivan Rakitic. Mohamed Salah. There's some potential in this move. Coutinho. Roberto Firmino. Another shot. And this is a goal. For Liverpool, it is looking pretty much now that the victory is assured. Oh, it's an enviable situation for them. Should be home and hosed. Well, here's the goal again. I don't think we expected this. Such a one-sided affair. But look at the scoreline. We need to cut that out with some sharp movement. Roberto Firmino. Nathaniel Clyne. Good athlete, Jordan Henderson, and he's showing it now. Jordan Henderson. It's Sadio Mane. Firmino. Still a chance in there off the goalkeeper. Iniesta. Barcelona moving smartly here. Su\u00e1rez. Iniesta! He blocked that well. Roberto Firmino. It's kept out incredibly by Ter Stegen. Well he's bailed his teammates out there. Here's Messi in these wide areas where he's such a danger. Roberto Firmino. Jordan Henderson. Well a corner to come because of that deflection. Iniesta is off. Goes to corner. All Peters out rather for them. And here's the shot. Lionel Messi. Lovren. Coutinho. Wijnaldum. Roberto Firmino. The shot's off. Here's a chance. Goalkeeper exposed. Please give a round of applause for today's man of the match. Number 10. Coutinho. Well now they've won the ball back in the middle of the park by intercepting that pass. Here's Clyne. Makes a challenge here. Oh it could be dangerous. Coutinho. The ball's loose. Goalkeeper made the save but he couldn't hold it. Luis Su\u00e1rez moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here. And that is the end. It's all over. Well look at that score line and it emphasizes what we've seen in the shape of the game as well. Very one-sided. Well from the first whistle they were on top and it never altered for the entire 90 minutes. Wonderful stuff. What a brilliant performance from this fella. Well so often we think of his creative abilities but a couple of goals here on the match for his team. Well as for the opposition it was a frustrating game for him. He really couldn't get into it and make the sort of impact."}]}

And listen, as a player, when you're playing for your country, it's always a huge match. And whether it's a friendly, whether it's a competitive one, for these players, this is a big, big day. Today's game features France against Argentina. It's an international fixture here, Alan, that will bring back memories for you and your England career. Well, it is a proud moment. You stand there, you sing along to the national anthem, and you just want to do yourself justice by presenting your country. And now it's time for the national anthems. It's on the subject of France and this wonderful group of young players that they've got. Yeah, and we talk about Clairefontaine, we have done so often down the years, and still it produces players like Mbappe and Dembele, wonderful young prospects. This is the starting eleven for France. Ugo Lloris starts in goal. Rafael Varane starts with Samuel Umtiti as the centre-backs. And in attack, Antoine Griezmann partners up with Olivier Giroud. Thank you. One thing to look out for from this team today is the way they try and win the ball back within seconds of losing it. Yeah, and they don't do it individually, they get backed up by a team-mate. They hunt in packs, and you've got to do that. You've got to do it with discipline. Terrific entertainment on offer here, I'm sure, as the game gets underway. France have regained the possession of the ball. Rafael Varane, coming on strong, looking to play their way through now. Gets his foot in there. Javier Mascherano. Perez. Got the opposition backpedalling a little bit. Mercado. Javier Mascherano. Lionel Messi. Got the tackle in. Griezmann. Togba. Conte. Javier Mascherano. And now Messi. And here's some attacking play from Argentina. He saw the look from the other player and saw where the pass was going and read it. Griezmann. Togba. Griezmann. Higua\u00edn. It's Messi. Javier Mascherano. Mercado. Played forward, a bit of menace in this attack. Eva Banega. Good defending. Griezmann. Not going to go for that yellow card here, just a free kick. Forward momentum is with France here. Promising build-up until that challenge. Perez cut that out well, well read. Strong challenge. Roman. Got the ball back. Javier Mascherano. Enzo Perez. Perez. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. Messi. Looked for a moment as though he got the geometry absolutely right as he tried to steer the ball in. I think his teammates, the crowd, were screaming for him to just put his foot through it. Get the laces onto the ball, but he's tried to go for accuracy. Able to cut that out with some sharp movement. Moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here. Cut off. That's great defending there, stopping that attack. Oh, charged down. You can see the deflection there, corner. Played in by Messi. Defended well. It's on the move all the time and makes lots of these interceptions. I just wonder, Alan, whether this will go France's way or maybe even go against them. Yeah, we're looking at it from kick-off. It's so difficult to read because there's not much to separate these two sides. Giroud with Griezmann. The shot's on. Close to it. France get the throw. Here's Hernandez. Hernandez. Conte. Mbappe. Griezmann. Griezmann. Well, what a start to the game. That would have been for them, Alan. The first goal coming so early, but not quite. He's kicking himself. He can't believe he's missed from so close in, too. Pogba. France working the ball cleverly into a really promising position. Crisp defending there. There will be a throw now after the tackle. They've got the ball rolling again straight away. Conte. Forward for Giroud. Mbappe. In a great position to pull it back. Pogba. Griezmann. Pogba. Not a threat at the moment, but they have got the ball and that, I suppose, is a threat. Could be dangerous. Conte. He's better at winning the ball and using it, Angelo Conte, but here he comes. Mbappe. Enzo Perez. He's screened the ball well there. A little piece of interplay between the two. Javier Mascherano. It goes out wide again. Nicolas Otamendi. Eva Banega. Back to Mascherano. Messi. Higuain. Magnificent from Higuain. From the goalkeeper. It's all about positioning and spreading his body. Top class keeping. And that's a corner Argentina's way.

Griezmann! Into the lead they go It's a fine, well-worked goal from a team that's looking well-oiled and looking very well-drilled They've been the better side, they've played with great panache up to this point and that goal really sums up the way they have been playing, excellent! That's a very good goal and much deserved the way the team are playing Yeah, the stats don't lie, the number of shots on target No surprise that they've scored That's good for France, they've got this lead Javier Mascherano Lionel Messi That's very good shielding of the ball That's a very good goal It's a very good goal It's a very good goal It's a very good goal It's a very good goal It's a very good goal It's a very good goal He's screened the ball well there Olivier Giroud Togba Played down the wing, keeping the wide attack going Drills it in Giroud The goalkeeper with a textbook save Keeps the ball in his grasp Under some pressure, he's shielded it well It's a combination of skill and will to hold off the opposition He's coming forward with some danger Togba A chance! It looked a bad miss I think that was a mistake It looked a bad miss I think the defender just put him off Yeah, he's got to take a lot of credit for that Because he had to take the shot quickly The lad who was trying to score Another turnover in play here with that interception And here they are, on the attack Here's Conte He can lay it off to the supporting player Griezmann I think he saw the look from the other player And saw where the pass was going And read it He's caught offside And you see what he's trying to do It's all about the timing of the run Well, the team that are in front Are going to try and keep in front With a change here The player being brought on from the bench And here's the goalkeeper And here's the goalkeeper And here's the goalkeeper And here's the goalkeeper The opponents around him That's good screening of the football Messi's got all the moves Some potential in this move He needs shots on him Now that's a corner for Argentina Corner swung in Here goes Lloris Stops it comfortably Dembele And here's the goalkeeper And here's the goalkeeper And here's the goalkeeper He's cut that out Well, well read Messi He's got some strength hasn't he To shield the ball like that Strong challenge Decision is a throw It was a fair tackle Klopp Mbappe Togba On the attack here Return ball Now it's Ousmane Dembele Now the shot Super goalkeeping Fronts have been given the corner Well, there's going to be an alteration now And with the team trailing You can understand why It's going to be an alteration In from Antoine Griezmann One in front They would be a lot more comfortable If they were two in front And they really could have been Yeah, Mike They look back on that With a bit of regret Because that was a great chance To extend the lead, wasn't it In from Antoine Griezmann One in front They would be a lot more comfortable If they were two in front And they really could have been Yeah, Mike They look back on that With a bit of regret Because that was a

attacking play from Argentina Maybe he'll cross it here Delivery to the far post They've defended with great organisation To get possession back After being under pressure for some time Well, the manager will be delighted With the way his team have played so far But he's going to make a substitution here Just to hope that he can retain this lead Good defensive clearance there Corner to come now Messi Taken by Messi And here's the shot He blocked that well Well, that's good defending Olivier Giroud Now it's Ousmane Dembele Just read the intentions of the opposition there To make the interception Well, we're in the last knockings of the game But we're still on the edge of our seats here It's that close An attack from Argentina Javier Mascherano He'll link the play from this sort of area Leo Messi Great challenge By a player who's been doing that all game Griezmann Pogba Matuidi Good screening And he's kept the ball Matuidi Coming on strong Looking to play their way through now Nice return pass Real chance What an opportunity to wrap up the match Oh yeah, that's what you need to be in these situations Clinical Have no mercy They just didn't show it there Really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now Lovely ball from Giroud Mbappe And he's put it away They're in, they've scored They're surely home and dry now look at that for a goal first time finish takes a lot of technique let's see the replay now just widen the margin here to 2-0 Javier Mascherano Aguero looking good this move reading of the by anticipating the pass Vanega Aguero that's very good shielding of the ball and it's a goal it's a good goal they pulled one back now they're only one behind now and there's still plenty of life in this match as they look to level it up well that's made it more interesting now the difference is only one well this is the team with all the momentum and I'll be hoping now to go on and score another and we restart the game 2-1 that's going to be a free kick given by the referee he's had a good game Hernandez here's Hernandez there's good progress with this attack Argentina's throw Javier Mascherano Sergio Aguero using his physical power to protect the ball Dembele Mbapp\u00e9 now they've got a chance in this part of the pitch good defensive clearance there intercepted well Giroud Dembele onto Mbapp\u00e9 Matuidi Giroud still just one goal down and it's really down to the goalkeeper that that's the situation yeah could have been over a long time ago had he not been for their number one Giroud in from Antoine Griezmann cleared away well away from goal now it's Ousmane Dembele Giroud let in the shot goal off the post and in well we see it again how close it was to maybe hitting the post and staying out but luck was with him in it

Giroud Javier Mascherana now here's a chance to get at the opposition that's good play by the defender because had he messed up then it would have cost a goal I'm sure trying to catch the other team out with a quick break here Giroud oh it's the post he's got it away that's it final whistle well he's had a very good game hasn't he well it was a really good finish to win his team the match and he could have easily scored that other one when it hit the woodwork we can't ignore Leo Messi it was a frustrating game for him he really couldn't get into it and make the sort of impact he was hoping for that's a big part of why they lost today I think Messi Higuain on the attack here Salah Griezmann using his physical power to Griezmann now it's Ousmane Dembele another shot shot for goalkeeping

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a British football commentator. Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome everybody, Martin Tyler along with Alan Smith, Alan looking forward to it today. Yeah I think so Martin, there's a really good buzz in the air here. The image of Didier Drogba at the final whistle in that semi-final when Iniesta scored right at the end will always be my first thoughts when Chelsea play Barcelona. Yeah, unforgettable moments and we have had some top class ties, I'm hoping a bit more of the same. Barcelona's line-up here, Marc-Andre Testegen starts in goal, Samuel Umtiti plays with Gerard Piquet in central defence, Ivan Rakitic plays with Iniesta in the middle, Luis Suarez is the lone striker today. It's a real group mentality in this line-up about pressing the opposition into making mistakes and cashing in on it straight away. Well it takes a lot of energy, a lot of motivation, it's easy to drop off and when you do drop off that really aggressive closing down, that's when it can fall down. Well this is the Wembley Stadium of today, it's been open since 2007, it's got its own memories and many of the supporters here will not perhaps think about the former stadium where you graced of course Alan on many famous occasions were staged, but this is where it's all about now, where it's at and it deserves to be here, it's a magnificent structure. It certainly is, I mean I think it's still regarded worldwide as the home of football and as a footballer you just want to do yourself justice out there. The coach official today is Luke Kulbaka. Chelsea have started the first half. It's a dangerous feel to this attack, it's looking good from their point of view. And then he goes for the tackle. Samuel Umtiti, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets. Kante. Hazard, a bit predictable with the passing and the opposition able to deal with that. They've got the ball back Barcelona. Lionel Messi, could be a chance here, they've got the ball into a good area. He's got his shot off now. Morata. Barcelona always expect to win, but they know this won't be easy. Kante. Trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. And here's the shot, very good stop here. Corner, Barcelona. Kante. Put the corner in the middle, a decent fist away by the keeper. Rakitic. Sergei Roberto. Well this attack has got a bit of menace to it. The shot's on! And that's easy for Courtois. Saw it coming, carried out, good work. Could really get at the opposition here. Morata. Still a chance in there off the goalkeeper. Chance to go at the opposition with pace. Taken on by De La Feu at pace. Victor Moses, fast line to get the throw. It's a wasted throw, he's given it straight to the opposition. Iniesta. Sergio Busquets. Iniesta. Ivan Rakitic. Sergei Roberto. It's good play, until they got that challenge in. Here's Kante. Here's an opportunity. Rakitic! The keeper has reached it and rescued his side. Kante. Kante. Kante. Kante. Kante. Morata. Sergei Roberto. Lionel Messi. It's Messi. And here they are on the attack. And here they are on the attack. Headed down to a teammate. Anticipated the direction of the pass and was able to intervene. Morata. Looked very good indeed, but the move was broken down. Jordi Alba. Iniesta. Sergio Busquets. It was good progress with this attack. Jordi Alba. Ivan Rakitic. Rakitic. Good stop by the goalkeeper. And now Iniesta. Ivan Rakitic. Sergei Roberto. Down the wing to the dangerous Messi. Good challenge here. A return ball. Cahill. Pedro. Kante. Morata. Kante. Rakitic. Iniesta. Attacking now. Shots on him. That's a good block. Well, they've got a corner out of that. A bit lucky. It was deflected. Iniesta. In goes the corner. Only partially clear. And now the shot! And that's easy for Courtois. Iniesta. It's looking good, this move. Got great dribbling skills and we're about to see them. Looking for Lionel Messi. That move nipped in the bud by the raising of the flag from the assistant. To me like the timing of the pass and the run was spot on but closer inspection. No, he was off. Suarez. Well, he's had a go and what a goal! Well, it's not often you see somebody find the back of the net from that distance. That is stunning. Well, he defied the odds by taking the shot on, let alone scoring the goal. That was perhaps the place where it was impossible to save it. No goalkeeper could have reached that. It clips the post on the way in. Yeah, really good strike. He took it early as well and I think that's what caught the goalie off guard as much as anything. Antonio Conte, not used to losing really in recent years but he's in that situation now and he's not happy. Good news for Barcelona, they lead. That's halftime, signalled by the referee, 1-0 the halftime score. Thoughts on Luis Suarez in the first half, Alan? Yeah, what a good time to score that was, putting his side in the lead. Wembley Stadium, the fans sit back in it for the start of the second half. Ivan Rakitic. They've got the ball in the middle of the pitch here. Pedro. Sergio Busquets. Now here's a chance to get at the opposition. Rakitic! Oh, what a fine goal. They lead by two now, they'll feel a little bit more comfortable and they're good value for this advantage at the moment. You've got to admire the way he placed the ball into the bottom corner of the net. The goalkeeper was in a decent position but he was helpless to stop that one going in. Just widen the margin here to 2-0. David Luis. Got on the ball in midfield, well read by the player in that part of the pitch. Ivan Rakitic. That's good movement forward here. It was good play until they got that challenge in. David Luis. In quickly. Marcus Alonso. Cahill. That's Filipe Cueta. Cahill. Here they are on the attack. He's got there. He turned it over the bar. I think we've got to pay credit to the fullback who's been marking the winger because he's given him nothing, hasn't he? So it's no surprise that the wide man's been substituted here. Nice and tight all match the fullback but when that happens you've got to try and mix up your game, give him something different to think about and he couldn't come up with the answer. He's got his shot off now. Throw to come up now after the ball's gone out. Morata. I think he saw the look from the other player and saw where the pass was going and read it. Attacking well here. What about this for a shot? Optimistic. Well, long overdue you feel this, James. The side that's behind. Switch of tactics now. To be replaced by... Liverpool. So it's Pogba now. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. Pogba. That's an easy interception. The pass wasn't really... Suarez! Oh, nowhere near. No, he's miscued that one. Miscued it badly. Conte. We've got a Conte. Sergi Roberto. Could be dangerous. Tried his luck! Oh, nowhere near. It was a long way out. Yeah, I think that's a waste to try his luck from there. Penalty. Here's Willian. Marcus Alonso. He can whip it in now. Tom! Easy for the goalkeeper, when really... Really bad for a knee. There was every chance of him being totally beaten then. He's got the ball. Yeah, he was exposed there, and he must have thought he was going to get beaten, but, well, the lad just made a real hash of it, didn't he? Just a case of finding the spare man. It's always available in their own half, and the opposition letting them do this at the moment, although they are trailing. That's it. This is certainly going to be within their range, now that the free kick has been given. So here comes the free kick. Well, he has gone for goal, but you wouldn't really know it. Look, he did it again. Well, well away from the target. No, he won't want to see that one back later tonight. Yes. Cesc Fabregas. Jordi Alba. Iniesta. Alba. They could pose some danger now. The shot's on! How did he reach that? Brilliant goalkeeping. Corner now for Barcelona. Barcelona. Corner swung in, goes for it with a fist. Samuel Umtiti. Now he's looking for support. Still a chance in there off the goalkeeper. Victor Moses. Hazard! Oh, they've shown him the inside. Morata! Going for goal! It's a goal, and it maybe will breathe a bit of life into these last few minutes. You've got to hand it to them, they haven't given this match up. Well, there's a goal that perhaps not gone according to the script here. They've just picked their moment to get forward after a lot of defending. Yeah, and they can thank the defenders for that, but when they didn't get the ball, they moved it forward really quickly. They were ruthless there. And we restart the game 2-1. Gerard Delefeu. Jordi Alba. Here's Willian. Azpilicueta. Can he clear his lines now? Being closed down. Gerard Delefeu. It's Messi. Ivan Rakitic. Sergi Roberto. Slipped through. I like the look of this attack. Messi! It's come off the goalkeeper, still in... That will be a free kick. Cesc Fabregas. He's on the move all the time and makes lots of these interceptions. It goes out wide again. And now Iniesta. The referee has given the free kick. Iniesta. Watch at that. With the corner comes a possibility of increasing their lead here. Attack is the best form of defence, they say. Swung in from the corner. Jotun has blocked the shot well. Jordi Alba. Well, no danger from that cross because the defender can cope with it easily. Victor Moses. Tight scenario here on the ball. The opposition holding on but Chelsea really challenging them now. It's come to an end now as the referee calls a halt. I've been quite impressed with them today. What about you? They've got a win. They have got a win and they've got some confidence on board. Some players who prove they can find the back of the net too. How do you think Luis Suarez did in the game today? Got himself a goal and put in a really good shift. Excellent performance. \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda They've got numbers in this attack and it looks dangerous Griezmann Olivier Giroud Griezmann Using his physical power to... Griezmann! Into the lead they go It's a fine, well-worked goal from a team that's looking well-oiled and looking very well-drilled They've been the better side, they've played with great panache up to this point and that goal really sums up the way they have been playing, excellent!

It is, and listen, as a player, when you're playing for your country, it's always a huge match, and whether it's a friendly, whether it's a competitive one, for these players, this is a big, big day. Welcome action for you from Russia, and today's main feature is Brazil will play Belgium. We talk about the highest level that a player can achieve, Alan, you had the honour of playing for England, and we've got two national teams here today. Oh, it's always a special moment, you pull on your nation's shirt, always a big game. This is no different. And now it's time for the national anthems. We do talk a lot, Alan, about footballers who are expected to win. I don't think there are any more pressured footballers in any club or any other country than those who play for Brazil. If you don't win any game, you're branded a failure. Yeah, and that's what makes their achievements all the more laudable. They seem able most of the time to be able to handle that pressure. One thing to look out for from this team today is the way they try and win the ball back within seconds of losing it. Yeah, and they don't do it individually, they get backed up by a team-mate, they hunt in packs. You've got to do that, you've got to do it with discipline. Check on the Belgium starting XI. Thibaut Courtois starts in goal, Jan Vertonghen plays with Toby Alderweireld as the centre-back. Kevin de Bruyne plays with Axel Witzel in the centre of the pitch. Hidden Azar starts together with Romelu Lukaku. What's this game going to bring us? We'll find out very shortly now, won't we? Because the game is underway. Now here's a chance to get at the opposition. That's a fine challenge, and he's got the ball. This turnover could be costly against a side that can break like this. That's a great interception. I like the look of this attack. It looked very good indeed, but the move has broken down. Felipe Luis. Nice return pass. Paulinho. Coutinho. Here's Casemiro, into the attacking third. Paulinho. He's got support here. Fania. Here's Casemiro. Here's Willian. Promising build-up until that challenge. Axel Witzel. Now this looks promising. Thomas Meunier. He can lay it off to the supporting player. Well, no danger from that cross, because the defender can cope with it easily. Coutinho. Coutinho. The teammates are clearly on the same wavelength. Gabriel Jesus. That's good movement forward here. Felipe Luis. He can cross it now. Neymar. That's good support play from his teammates. And here's the shot. Fantastic save. It'll be a corner. Coutinho. Coutinho. Coutinho. Coutinho. Coutinho. Coutinho. Coutinho. Coutinho. Corner played into the middle. Good defensive clearance there. On the move and able to cut out the pass. Paulinho. On to Willian. Paulinho! That's easy for Courtois. Axel Witzel. Good work, really, to read the intention of the pass. Backing his own talent here to keep the ball. And he has got some support if he wants to just lay it off. Gabriel Jesus. They've got to be careful with these early challenges. The referees penalised that one. Well, that's going to be the first booking, isn't it, of the match, Alan? Well, early on in matches, quite often referees, they don't like to book players. But this ref had no hesitation. Oh, the manager not happy with that tackle on his player. He thinks the stud's showing. Very good distance to the clearance. Axel Witzel. Hazard. They could pose some danger now. It's good play until they got that challenge in. Here's Casemiro. Coutinho. Gabriel Jesus. There's the interception. Good decision. Felipe Luis. Now Casemiro. Nice bit of interplay between these two. Carlinho. There's good progress with this attack. Kvanje. And he's knocked it out of play, the defender. Felipe Luis. Quick into the tackle. And the result is going to be a throw. Thiago Silva. Neymar. He's cut that out. Well, well read. Well, the Brazil team lined up and ready to go in a game. Where even their considerable talents might be stretched. It takes something to match the quality of Brazil. But his opposing side is getting somewhere close. Couldn't keep it in play. It's gone out for a throw. Now Dries Mertens. Now Casemiro. Now Casemiro. Thiago Silva. Felipe Luis. Neymar. Max Ovitzel. There's a dangerous feel to this attack. It's looking good from their point of view. It's a good cross. Well, here could be a chance for the corner. In goes the corner. A decent fist away by the keeper. They might open them up now. Carrasco. Chance for the cross. Comes in with a tackle. Got the ball. And they're going at the opposition with speed. Here's Casemiro. Willingham. Here's the chance. Well, here it is, the first goal of the game that they have absolutely dominated, very good play, defence opened up again but the difference is this time that they put the ball past the goalkeeper, good finish and they're looking a very classy side at the moment. A goal from Willian and what a goal from him that was, he's put his laces through it and it's flown past the keeper. And here is another angle on that goal. Brazil then with the lead. Jan Vertonghen, nice interplay between the two of them. Eden Hazard, played forward a bit of menace in this attack. Strong challenge. Gabriel Jesus. Neymar can go on here, excellent play too, loses marker. Defender has to be quick. Well, that's proper defending, they can't score from there, it's out of play. Neymar, now Casimiro, Gabriel Jesus, getting forward well as a team now. It was a real opportunity but there might be a key moment in there from a defensive point of view. Yeah, well they really did converge on him quickly. He didn't miss by much but he's missed it. Look at the manager, he knows that miss might just come back to haunt his team. He could have gone two up there. So good. Felipe Luis has given away a foul now. So Axel Witzel, Mertens. Comes in with a tackle, Thiago Silva. Miranda. Now Casimiro. Well, they are in the lead and they are on the ball but on their own half at the moment. Mertens. Yannick Carrasco. And here they are on the attack. Now Dries Mertens. Good strong tackle. Good strong tackle. Good support play from his teammates. That would be a throw. Miranda. Here's Casimiro. Felipe Luis. Coutinho. On to the attack now. Space to cross the ball now. That attack was looking good. Now the opposition have a chance. Hazard. Kevin De Bruyne. Gabriel Jesus. Felipe Luis. Mertens. It's De Bruyne. The target, Hazard. Only partially away from danger. A couple of teammates who are clearly on the same wavelength. Neatly intercepted. Just to keep a debate. Oh, that's typical of football, isn't it? How have they come back? There was no way it seemed that they were going to equalize. They found a room to go. The goalkeeper who'd been beaten is mad with his defenders. They just allowed the scorer in and he did his job. Well, he gets the credit. And the credit was being in the right place at the right time. Yeah, I think the easiest goal to score this entire season. It is level. Both sides have scored here now. It's Casemiro. Coutinho. Lukaku. Free kick against Brazil. Max Orvizzo. They've got numbers in this attack and it looks dangerous. Miscued really with the header. Yeah, not known for his heading and you can see why there with that effort. Gabriel Jesus. In quickly. Clever and quick. Gabriel Jesus. Now he can cross it. Felipe Luis. And there is some backup for him in this position. Shots on him. Willian. A little credit for taking a volley on but in the end nowhere near the target. Well, it's a difficult skill when you get it off a fraction and that can happen. It goes wide. The manager just trying to get his message across down there. They weren't far off taking the lead there. They're playing pretty well. Paulinho. Here's Willian. Coutinho. Now they've got a chance in this part of the pitch. That's a brilliant challenge. Mernier. Mertens. Here's Casemiro. That'll be all the wide out. Thomas Mernier. With Mertens. Moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here. That's great defending there. Stopping that attack. It's a good cross. Made away. Well, he's tried that from long range. Praise for trying the shot, Alan. Well, his teammates aren't too happy. Mernier. Coutinho. Under some pressure he shielded it well. Played forward a bit of menace in this attack. Quick-witted and quick in his movement too to intercept there. Here's Willian. It will be a free kick here. Casemiro. It's rather skewed off his head in the end. Yeah, he didn't catch it properly. I think he probably closed his eyes there It is four brakes left How long ago How lean you I'm here supporting player alongside It's trying to get the ball back now It could have got through there, but the defender was absolutely on top of his game With forward play from them and it has on But I'm well under pressure here to hold the ball as the challenge came in comes in with a tackle That's so big so Kevin the Prada It has it The tenure That's so good The backheel doesn't come off Gabrielle Jesus Oh To William shots off Keepers love to be busy and he's certainly busy at the moment They frame of the goal helping him out And now at least he can settle his team down and get the ball up field Well, if you hit the postal bar, you've not at the target, you know, they did in the second one It's too easy for the keeper This looks promising Excellent cross from as a spring the ball. Well, but Maybe all the white elf Gabrielle Jesus now, here's a chance to get at the opposition Oh Well, that was so close to going inside the post but it's just straight past the outside Yeah, I think he's beaten the keeper, you know, but just not got it within the framework of the goals and he's a bit unlucky The manager just hoping that that miss is not going to come back to haunt them They are creating chances, but that was a costly miss You Gabrielle Jesus, we've got a free kick here referee points for it Oh Well, the keeper got to that and probably should have done yeah, you would expect it to save it and he did The referee is blown for halftime at 1-1 Well the play that we're really looking at today William he's he's done well It has been really lively might just be kicking himself that he couldn't add to that goal, but it's in the woodwork Support play from his teammates. Here's the shot fantastic save Really here's the chance Deeply intercepted I Believe they're Luis and there is some backup for him in this position shots on here William On to William the shots on I suppose You It's Brazil who start this second half Could be dangerous got the opposition backpedaling a little bit The team you It's a good goal for them and they have been playing well No one can really complain about them taking the lead here. They have been much the better side It's a fine piece of finishing They took it with greater plumb. I'm sure getting the first goal gave him the confidence to grab the second chance here Good luck here again by the replay of the goal Oh Look at the manager he works hard on his team on the training ground and seen some reward for it down there now They'll have the lead So bits of Yannick Carrasco Trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation, here's the shot the team you Paulina Is William Very good tackle not his first today either Nice return pass Kevin to Brian Played forward a bit of menace in this attack Kevin to Brian Marnie a Shot off now. Oh, no, we're there. No, he's miscued that one. He's cutie badly Oh We'll be pleased to get the advantage here they can play off Opponents around him that's good screening of the football run back very quickly Paulinho His Casimiro read the intentions of the opposition there to make the interception Well, this attack could have been a menace to it Across from Aden as a Header was going in but it was pretty straightforward for the keeper to stop that happening Yeah, he's thrown his cup on that one as near the keeper easy me Nice thing to play between the two of them Felipe Luis Coutinho Neymar now, they've got a chance in this part of the pitch The ball to the opposition Paulinho Gabriel Jesus Some potential in this attack Kevin to Brian Marnie Marnie Marnie Marnie Marnie Marnie Marnie Marnie Marnie Some potential in this move Neymar puts it into the middle Good defensive clearance there Paulinho Azar Ball in behind from Azar He's in! Lukaku! That's a brilliant stop Corner Top player, top performance today from him Right on his game He's being substituted now And the crowd have loved watching his performance Yeah, it's just all gone right Doesn't happen all the time, but One of those days where he didn't really put a foot wrong De Bruyne's corner It's a promising situation He could have made more of that It's a combination of skill and will To hold off the opposition Fernandinho Lukaku Mertens Azar Asovicso It's a poor touch And the possession's gone away Eden Hazard Here's Casemiro Lukaku Under some pressure he's shielded it well And then covered out Carlinho Lukaku It's Brazil breaking forward Gabriel Jesus Neymar A look at the ref And he says penalty! Didn't hesitate, did he? Pointed to the spot Genuine attempt to go for the ball Yeah, it was a forwards tackle in many ways A poor one He scored from the spot Neymar Not something you did too often in your distinguished career But a penalty here Neymar, such a skillful player And from 12 yards he's almost unstoppable Neymar While time is ticking away It's time for a change and here it comes Just a reminder, 3-1 it is now The scorer Now company Here's Carrasco Just lent the ball to his mate and got it back again Here comes the challenge Here's Willian Carlinho Jan Vertonghen Janne Carrasco There's good progress with this attack That's very good shielding of the ball Good punch from the goalkeeper from the cross Jaton That's a corner In from De Bruyne Shots on here Comes out of the goalkeeper Using his physical power to protect the ball Getting forward well as a team now He's screened the ball well there De Bruyne And now the shot And the referee spotted that deflection He's pointed for the corner And in it goes That's good defending Quick witted And that's a goal No it's not It's a penalty And it's a goal What a goal That was a goal And a penalty And a penalty And a penalty And a penalty Defending Quick witted And quick in his movement too To intercept there Now, can he take them on Trying to pick out someone in the centre Defended well Come well under pressure here to hold the ball as the challenge came in Fania William To make sure that The defender doesn't nick it from him And here's the shot Fernandinho Good strong tackle Good screening And he's kept the ball Paulinho The shot's on And that is quite a wild effort at goal Although he got good contact on the ball A lot of pre-game talk About Neymar Certainly not disappointed me in the game Alan, what do you think? He's got that ability to find space Within shooting distance And he's done it really well today And found the back of the net too Now here's a chance to get at the opposition On the move and able to cut out the pass Here's Carrasco Mertens Diana Carrasco Striding forward purposefully Comes in with a tackle Felipe Luis Paulinho Now Fernandinho Prepared to just pass the ball around in their own half Winning the game as the scoreline tells you Here's Carrasco That's a combination of skill And will to Hold off the opposition How defensive have they become at the moment Sitting in their own half Opposition pass the ball around in front of them Maybe they feel they're not going to be hurt Some potential in this move Anticipated the direction of the pass And was able to intervene Paulinho It's a quick break Just buying his team a bit of time By holding the ball up And shoots! The goalkeeper Yeah it's a wonderful stop Martin isn't it And no bits and pieces either to follow up on Neymar's corner Well the goalkeeper takes charge here from the corner Neymar's corner Mertens Thomas Merlier Could be dangerous The target has up And it's a straight forward save Yeah that was Piki Ceres He saved that 100 times out of 100 Here's Mertens Looked very good indeed But the move has broken down Trying to stretch the opposition Using the wider areas here Fania Fernandinho And opponents around him That's good screening of the football Hazard Push the other team out with a quick break here And they've cut it out Merlier Kevin de Bruyne So we'll restart with a throw in Does seem as though there's action on the Brazil bench Now Fernandinho, under some pressure he shielded it well. A timely challenge, Eden Hazard, Fellaini, Gianni Carrasco, going forward well. That's good play once more, he's knocked it out of harm's way, Fellaini. It was good progress with this attack. Good play from the referee here, playing the advantage. Shots on here, credit to them, they're still having a go here. Although if they'd got that one in, it really would have been game on. Yeah, I mean, two goals down, but they haven't played badly. And if that had gone in, that would have gained some faith and confidence. Kevin De Bruyne, trying to get involved, I think, the forward by coming this deep to get on the ball. He's coming forward with some danger. Thiago Silva. Played down the wing, keeping the wide attack going. Felipe Luis, good defending. Closing him down, Hazard. On the move and able to cut out the pass. Now Fernandinho. Now Casemiro. Felipe Luis. Really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now. Fellaini. Brings some company. Toby Alderweireld. Kevin De Bruyne. That's out, this will be a throw. Now he's a bit disappointed, he's going to be taken off here. And the manager may be saving him for another day, but also allowing him to get the full appreciation from the fans. Well, he was enjoying it, I don't think he wanted to come off, but he's a key part of this team, he's got to be protected. And now he's looking for some support. Comes in with a tackle. Thiago Silva. His company. That's very good shielding of the ball. Delivered it to the box. And they get it away. Bit of space to go forward into with the ball. Roberto Firmino. Good screening, and he's kept the ball. Change of possession here. Referee's done extremely well to judge it like that, he can play the advantage. Into the attacking third. Must score! And here he comes, he wants to do it to the goalkeeper, up for the corner. In from De Bruyne. Matunga! He's made the save. And he passes back to the keeper. Done well under pressure here to hold the ball as the challenge came in. Miranda. Fania. Getting forward well as a team now. And opponents around him, that's good screening of the football. Excellent work with the tackle. It's a combination of skill and will to hold off the opposition. Fania. Neymar. And that will be a corner. Well, the players have done well for this team today, but I think the fans might have done even better. Yeah, and they're really enjoying it now, aren't they? They've got no doubt in their minds that their team is going to win out. Neymar's corner, defended well. Willian, good challenge. Jan Vertonghen. Fania. Neymar. Now Fernandinho. He's got some strength, hasn't he, to shield the ball like that. Jan Vertonghen. Great quickly when they get possession. He's held the ball up well there, waiting for the support. He showed well and got the ball, but he's lost it straight away. The crowd love this. A goalkeeper coming up for a corner. FANS ROAR He's screened the ball well, but... Final whistle. FANS ROAR It was absolutely extraordinary, exceptional, elegant, excellent. Well, so often we think of his creative abilities, but a couple of goals here have won the match for his team. WHISTLE BLOWS Willian. Here's the chance. Neatly intercepted. Just to keep it a bait. FANS ROAR Coutinho. And shoots. Willian. FANS ROAR He scored from the spot. Into the attacking third. Must score. Here he comes, he wants to do it too, the goalkeeper up for the corner."}]}

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What's going on guys and girls, it's Zach from SwitchForce and we are here with FIFA 18 on Nintendo Switch. This is a monumental moment, we've been waiting for this release for quite some time, third party support has been strong as of late, we got NBA 2K18, we had reveals of LA Noire and Doom and Wolfenstein 2. Will FIFA 18 be another notch in Nintendo's arsenal for the Switch, we're going to dive in and see what it's all about. Pretty pumped, I have not played this version yet, I saw it at E3, obviously I've seen some videos and what not, but this will be my first time getting hands on with this, which is pretty darn cool. So this version of FIFA is much more of a custom version of FIFA in relation to the other versions of FIFA 18 in comparison to something like NBA 2K18 which is much more of a straight 1-to-1 port from the PS4 and Xbox One versions. And look at this, here we go, it's freaking FIFA on the Switch, we're going to just dive right in and play. We can do career, ultimate team, so if you want to see anything specific in the next video definitely let me know. There is no journey mode unfortunately, but we can just kick off and go, so it's downloading and applying online squads it looks like. I just want to get in and play a game and see how it plays, see how it feels. I'm using the pro controller, I can also do a handheld video if that is important to you guys and you want to see that. Here we can play with a friend, split the controller, that's pretty cool. I'm using a classic controller, I will be the home team. And we'll rock Real Madrid, and who should we play against? We're going to go there, and then we'll play against Barcelona, that feels good. Ooh, I like a lot of cool jerseys, we're going to rock these black and blue, sounds good, and we'll face off against the red just because that looks good. Alright, so here we go, you can customize controls, that's interesting. Auto switching, different assists, that's pretty nice. Alright, so I'm going to leave this all default just to see how the default plays, game settings wise. Yeah, 6 minutes is good, 3pm, beautiful, I like this, looking good. So we should be ready for action, and let's play. Dynamically adjust the difficulty level to give you the best experience, okay. That is sounding fine, here is our advanced dribbling bronze. Dribble through the highlighted gates as fast as possible, alright, so we can do like a little action here. Look at us go, look at us go, it feels pretty good, it actually looks pretty darn good. Back through the gate, ow, dang Ronaldo, it's tough, alright, so press the d-pad to play the match. Click the d-pad, what am I pressing, good, yay, oh, pressing the plus button, haha. What's the feeling about La Liga and Barcelona, Barcelona and Real Madrid sometimes told that they only have easy games to play apart from the Clasicos, that's not the case at all is it, there's some tremendous competition in this league. Well they're the team that everybody wants to topple, aren't they, along with Real Madrid and with that comes a lot of pressure for the players that wear this kit. It's an honour, isn't it, to be here at the Bernabeu, it is an iconic football stadium, and Real Madrid stand for so much that's good in the game. It has got a certain magic attached to it and I have to say I've been to all the big stadiums in Europe, in the world, and this is my favourite, it's magnificent. Alright, I think we are just about ready to go, Sergio Ramos' name is shaking there, he's just excited to see the Switch version, all in all it looks pretty darn good, now I am playing it obviously docked so that I can record it, with most of these games they look a little crisper when you're in handheld mode, sometimes they don't depending on how it's set up, but we are ready for action, so it's going to give us some tool tips it looks like. And we'll just have to get used to the controls here because obviously I've never played it on Switch. Hey! Oh jeez. Give me the ball, give me the ball, alright. Alright, now I am no expert at FIFA so please, please don't expect some crazy performance here, this is not my style, this is not really my game, but I did want to check it out and bring it to you and see what we can do. Ooh, so close there, almost beautiful. It looks good though don't you think, like I'm impressed so far, to me it has a better like first blush look than NBA did, NBA had a little blur to it, which I wasn't really a fan of, but this one looks, I like how this one looks, quite a bit. Ah no, I didn't want to pass it straight up, okay, God I haven't played FIFA in a long time but I used to like, back when I was in school, I would have so many epic FIFA matches just because it's like one of those like great games that everyone kind of likes to duke it out in. Ronaldo, oh God here he goes, ooh good shot CR let's go, it looks good doesn't it, yeah I think I'm going to do a handheld video as well, and anything, anything else you want to see let me know, UK use the left trigger to aim, tap Y for loopy, it's just weird to see the buttons, like I know what the buttons are, but it's just weird you know to see the different looks, okay so let's go, kind of have to hold it, ah right at the goalie, okay my bad, what I'm saying is the controls make sense, it's just weird to see the button prompts I'm used to like PS4, Xbox One button prompts, uh oh, there we go, get it back for us, let's go baby, I shouldn't let him, okay we're good, ooh just a way too light of a shot, let me know if you guys notice anything that's like ooh like if you've been playing the Xbox One or PS4 version you're like ooh that doesn't look good or that doesn't match up, obviously this is not running on Frostbite so it's not going to look as crazy cool as the other versions, but it still looks I think good, ooh nice moves there, thank you for the ball, okay let's play a, let's see, nice through ball, he's going to kick it way the heck out of there, all right got some space, yeah goal, let's go there's our first goal, first FIFA Switch goal from Ronaldo and I'm knocking over consoles and I'm not celebrating, yes I am, okay it's a little bit of a celebration, boom, boom, boom, boom, look at that, let's go baby, good play, all right here we go, doing good work, staying alive, we can get rid of those prompts now I think, make things a little cleaner and crisper for you, so far so good though right, like so far really so good, ooh another good shot, we're keeping the ball completely pressured in the Barcelona side of the field, yes, ooh, ah that was so freaking close, all right I'm super pumped by how good this play is, how good this looks, I'll be curious to try a little Joy-Con action in handheld, because I know not everybody has a pro controller, but it feels real good on the pro controller, I think the pro controller is just a damn good controller, there's nothing really, like I don't really ever have anything bad to say about the pro controller, I wish they were making a Mario Odyssey pro controller, I guess that's kind of a negative, but they are doing that cool Xenoblade 2, I'll definitely be picking that one up, I like the way that looks a lot, it's got that like cool cross in the middle of the X, these guys are doing good work, let's get it out of here, almost halftime, running through our first FIFA footage, I think the character models look good, I will say, just to have like some comparison, obviously different companies, different games, different focus, different scope, but I think the character models look better in NBA, I think that in general the game seems to look and run better in FIFA, so it inspires the discussion, like what is the better course to take, to make a complete 1 to 1 port, like they tried to do with 2K, or to do More of like a custom engine thing like they've done here with FIFA. What's gonna deliver the best experience? You know do you want it to run and as smooth and look as good as possible? Or do you want it to be as comparable as possible to the other parts like that's kind of like the Debate and the dilemma that you have to make and we'll probably have a discussion on that because I think it's definitely an interesting one And you know different people are gonna have obviously different opinions on what they what they value what they want Do they want it to be something? Oh come on man? Do they want it to be something that? You know feels just like they bought it on Xbox one They want it to be something that is optimized for switch I know I think I lean honestly more towards optimization like I would really love something That's like super optimized and runs in place super good. Then something that tries to have you know like a Direct comparison with a more powerful console counterpart. Oh That's gonna be no foul All right Well that was quickly done That's a nice bit of skill, but the defense. Oh good good good good That was close call. I've got a couple minutes left here Let's go Run for it Ronaldo There we go that's two nothing baby Sergio Ramos puts it through Beautiful passing beautiful goal the character miles actually aren't that bad. I think the NBA ones are just really nice the detail is super up-close You got less players, so you're able to put more emphasis and focus This is pretty sweet All right, let's go To nil before half time really getting the hang of it now, and I get man. I wish this had the journey That's the only thing that like really makes me just sad because it would be so cool to play the journey on the go You know that's kind of there's been some hassle with it obviously you know in terms of online not online etc But being able to play my career on the go with NBA is like a huge huge benefit That's the first shot. They've had all day We'll just boot it out of here that two minutes of extra time We'll see They can do anything with it putting some pressure on here Which is always? Where you worry about things kind of? Getting a little scary nice shot there Wide and that's gonna be halftime all right, but you oh beautiful Cool cool cool nice. This is a good game. Let's see what we got going on a half time presentation wise I I I Alright two zero seven shots two shots. We actually have less possession But we're dominating as far as I can see trainer match back settings and match instant replay Looking good. Let's resume this match and get back to the action Let me know your thoughts in the comments down below. How do you feel about this version? What do you guys think about it? How do you feel are you interested in picking it up? It comes out tomorrow? You can get the physical version you can download it. I have really fast Internet it took me about I don't know two and a half hours to download. It's like 15 gigs which is a lot But they aren't requiring a memory card like NBA which is interesting So that's pretty cool, we're gonna push the ball now well, no one's even hello What I'm too fancy for you, he's looking for some support Oh Dang you would have just taken an extra second. I guess to get more power behind that kick Good all right here we go I got a nice to Oli. Let's see if we can extend that I feel good There we go, let's bring it to the other side ah no we're gonna have a breakaway Good so I like to see Good good look Wow no Dang this game just got so much more interesting he has to bring it at two to one. That's a horrible play by me I'm so sorry Let's go, I don't want I don't want to see this anymore I mean, it's good to see the cool replays and the switch engine and everything, but I've had enough of you Had an ow gosh Barcelona is really coming through in the clutch here. It's not even really the clutch Yeah, just like the beginning of the second half there. We're making too long of passes I guess we got a little too overconfident at halftime Let's go All right do what you will do what you want our ball Wonderful contact on the ball there Modric Nice move Okay Ooh dang that was close out of bounds Oh B I'm also like super pumped for golf story. It's like a sports renaissance lately on switch. Oh Oh Wow really defending well here in the second half this game got I felt like we really dominated the first half But all of a sudden I guess they adjust the difficult That's probably why you remember how that said the difficulty would be adjusted dynamically based on how we played So that's what's happening here, which is interesting and cool You know I think they've done a good good job with that of all of a sudden making it a far more competitive game All right look like the coach wanted to throw for a second Louie Suarez good passes not for long Let's go ah ran the wrong way when inside I should've gone outside Okay kick it way back way way way back I know we're harassing quite aggressively here Ivan Rakitic Guys are good at passing all right there we go Nullify their attack a little bit there Forgot how much I like FIFA. It's like a nice like I don't know there's a strategy to it that you don't see as much In like NDA or men that I appreciate Good shot But it shouldn't be the case It shouldn't be the case, I don't know that was a good defense there Now Really strong play in the tackle Go baby go baby go baby go Nothing to split the two sides when you're looking for somebody should have passed that Say G Roberto Well these guys are tough sorry for getting quiet I'm just getting nervous because they're making some pretty good plays there. We got two on two on us. Yes good turn there, baby No Okay stepping in with a challenge hey, dude Yep there we go all right, let's go Play that through Put a pressure on the player, that's why it's a really defensive Second-half here, I mean they got their goal, but both teams are really battling hard Lay on advantage No No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Lukaku! That's a brilliant stop Corner Top player, top performance today from him Right on his game He's being substituted now And the crowd have loved watching his performance Yeah, it's just all gone right Doesn't happen all the time, but One of those days where he didn't really put a foot wrong De Bruyne's corner It's a promising situation He could have made more of that It's a combination of skill and will To hold off the opposition Fernandinho Lukaku Mertens Azar Asovicso It's a poor touch And the possession's gone away Eden Hazard Here's Casemiro Lukaku Under some pressure he's shielded it well And then covered out Carlinho Lukaku It's Brazil breaking forward Gabriel Jesus Neymar A look at the ref And he says penalty! Didn't hesitate, did he? Pointed to the spot Genuine attempt to go for the ball Yeah, it was a forwards tackle in many ways A poor one He scored from the spot Neymar Not something you did too often in your distinguished career But a penalty here Neymar, such a skillful player And from 12 yards he's almost unstoppable Neymar While time is ticking away It's time for a change and here it comes Just a reminder, 3-1 it is now The scorer Now company Here's Carrasco Just lent the ball to his mate and got it back again Here comes the challenge Here's Willian Carlinho Jan Vertonghen Janne Carrasco There's good progress with this attack That's very good shielding of the ball Good punch from the goalkeeper from the cross Jaton That's a corner In from De Bruyne Shots on here Comes out of the goalkeeper Using his physical power to protect the ball Getting forward well as a team now He's screened the ball well there De Bruyne And now the shot And the referee spotted that deflection He's pointed for the corner And in it goes That's good defending Quick witted And it's a goal How about that That's a goal There you go That's a goal There you go There you go That's a goal There you go Defending Quick witted and quick in his movement too To intercept there Now can he take them on Trying to pick out someone in the centre Defended well Come well under pressure here To hold the ball as the challenge came in Fania William Good defending To make sure that the defender doesn't nick it from him And here's the shot Fernandinho Good strong tackle Good screening and he's kept the ball Paulinho The shot's on And that is quite a wild effort at goal Although he got good contact on the ball He's got that ability to find space Within shooting distance And he's done it really well today And found the back of the net too Now here's a chance to get at the opposition On the move and able to cut out the pass Here's Carrasco Mertens Diana Carrasco Striding forward purposefully Comes in with a tackle Felipe Luis Paulinho Now Fernandinho Prepared to just pass the ball around in their own half Winning the game as the scoreline tells you Here's Carrasco That's a combination of skill And will To hold off the opposition How defensive have they become at the moment Sitting in their own half Opposition pass the ball around in front of them Maybe they feel they're not going to be hurt Some potential in this move Anticipated the direction of the pass And was able to intervene Paulinho It's a quick break Just buying his team a bit of time Holding the ball up And shoots The goalkeeper Yeah it's a wonderful stop Martin isn't it And no bits and pieces either to follow up on Neymar's corner Well the goalkeeper takes charge here from the corner Neymar's corner Mertens Thomas Merlier Could be dangerous The target has up And it's a straight forward save Yeah that was Piki Ceres He saved that 100 times out of 100 Here's Mertens Looked very good indeed But the move has broken down Trying to stretch the opposition Using the wider areas here Fania Fernandinho And opponents around him That's good screening of the football Hazard Push the other team out with a quick break here And they've cut it out Merlier Kevin de Bruyne So we'll restart with a throw in Does seem as though there's action on the Brazil bench Now Fernandinho, under some pressure he shielded it well. A timely challenge, Eden Hazard, Fellaini, Gianni Carrasco, going forward well. That's good play once more, he's knocked it out of harm's way, Fellaini. It was good progress with this attack. Good play from the referee here, playing the advantage. Shots on here, credit to them, they're still having a go here. Although if they'd got that one in, it really would have been game on. Yeah, I mean, two goals down, but they haven't played badly. And if that had gone in, that would have gained some faith and confidence. Kevin De Bruyne, trying to get involved, I think, the forward by coming this deep to get on the ball. He's coming forward with some danger. Thiago Silva. Played down the wing, keeping the wide attack going. Felipe Luis, good defending. Closing him down, Hazard. On the move and able to cut out the pass. Now Fernandinho. Now Casemiro. Felipe Luis. Really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now. Fellaini. Brings some company. Toby Alderweireld. Kevin De Bruyne. That's out, this will be a throw. Now he's a bit disappointed, he's going to be taken off here. And the manager may be saving him for another day, but also allowing him to get the full appreciation from the fans. Well, he was enjoying it, I don't think he wanted to come off, but he's a key part of this team, he's got to be protected. And now he's looking for some support. Comes in with a tackle. Thiago Silva. His company. That's very good shielding of the ball. Delivered it to the box. And they get it away. Bit of space to go forward into with the ball. Roberto Firmino. Good screening, and he's kept the ball. Change of possession here. Referee's done extremely well to judge it like that, he can play the advantage. Into the attacking third. Must score! And here he comes, he wants to do it to the goalkeeper, up for the corner. In from De Bruyne. Matunga! He's made the save. And he passes back to the keeper. Done well under pressure here to hold the ball as the challenge came in. Miranda. Fania. Getting forward well as a team now. And opponents around him, that's good screening of the football. Excellent work with the tackle. It's a combination of skill and will to hold off the opposition. Fania. Neymar. And that will be a corner. Well, the players have done well for this team today, but I think the fans might have done even better. Yeah, and they're really enjoying it now, aren't they? They've got no doubt in their minds that their team is going to win out. Neymar's corner, defended well. Willian, good challenge. Jan Vertonghen. Fania. Neymar. Now Fernandinho. He's got some strength, hasn't he, to shield the ball like that. Jan Vertonghen. Great quickly when they get possession. He's held the ball up well there, waiting for the support. He showed well and got the ball, but he's lost it straight away. The crowd love this. A goalkeeper coming up for a corner. FANS ROAR He's screened the ball well, but... Final whistle. FANS ROAR It was absolutely extraordinary, exceptional, elegant, excellent. Well, so often we think of his creative abilities, but a couple of goals here have won the match for his team. WHISTLE BLOWS Willian. Here's the chance. Neatly intercepted. Just to keep it a bait. FANS ROAR Coutinho. And shoots. Willian. FANS ROAR He scored from the spot. Into the attacking third. Must score. Here he comes, he wants to do it too, the goalkeeper up for the corner."}]}

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's always worth looking at these international matches. Yeah, and it will be interesting seeing how the players react because one or two new to the international scene, so nerves might play a part. You are the second-quickest youth country, it takes a bit of time, we'll see what's the case here. Coming up for you, Belgium, they play Tunisia. We talk about the highest level that a player can achieve, Alan, you had the honour of playing for England, and we've got two national teams here today. It's always a special moment, you pull on your nation's shirt, always a big game, this is no different. And now it's time for the national anthems. The line-up for Belgium today, Thibaut Courtois starts in goal, Jan Vertonghen plays with Toby Alderweireld as the centre-back, Kevin de Bruyne plays with Axel Witsel in the centre of the pitch, and three more, all attackers, to round off the team. This is the starting eleven for Tunisia. He looks as though the manager has set up a team here, whatever happens, we're not going to be beaten today. It does look that way, doesn't it, and I hope it's not adult affairs, because we've seen these managers set up teams in the past, and just concentrating on a clean sheet. The teams are ready, and bursting to get the game underway. They gave it straight to him, didn't they? Under some pressure, he's shielded it well. Kouabi Kazri. Lukaku. Looking good, this move. Kouabi Kazri. Slity. Should really deliver from this position, with the defender in the way. It's gone out for a throw. Malou. Slity. And here comes the support. Put into the middle. Very good distance to the clearance. Guided on by his head. Kazri! Very sharp reaction save from close in. It'll be a corner. It's rather skewed off his head in the end. Yeah, he didn't catch it properly. I think he probably closed his eyes there. Well, he has missed it, and what an invitation to Spurn, Alan. Oh, what a golden opportunity, because that was a really good ball in from out wide, and just didn't time his header. Tobi Alderweireld. Hazard. Well, he's big, he's brawny, and I can tell he's a very intelligent young man as well, Romelu Lukaku, who is forging his career now. A strong, strapping Belgian striker. Two in his previous match, really helped his team then. He has to be very quick. Eden Hazard. Hazard. They've got numbers in this. To put them in front! He's reached it, and turned it aside. And that's gone behind for a corner. WHISTLE BLOWS De Bruyne's delivery. And shoots! It's bounced back into play from the... It's in! It's a great start for them. A wonderful goal. We'll now have to see whether that will change both managers' approach to this game. WHISTLE BLOWS Didn't he get it right? The leap, the plotting of the trajectory as the ball came in, and the contact with the head. When you can do that, when you can jump like he can, he's such a strong player. Very hard to stop. WHISTLE BLOWS So the first goal, it's 1-0. They're new, sir. Badri. Maria. Wabi Qazri. Trying to get the ball in behind. Could be a chance here. They've got the ball into a good area. Opportunity here! And that will be a corner. Corner's taken. Defended well. Malou. That's good movement forward here. Put in from the wide area. Well, the ball's gone out for a goal kick. Let's have another look at it, Alan. Lukaku's goal, it's given them the lead here. Well, it's one of those where he was on his toes. He wasn't very wanting when it cannoned back off the woodwork. That's a goal. Axel Witzel. Slity. Now, here's a chance to get at the opposition. It was a foul. The referee's seen the situation and he can play on. Good work from him. Mertens. Toby Alderweireld. Here's Carrasco. Here's Mertens. Under some pressure, he's shielded it well. This could lead to a chance. It's good attacking play. Defender blocks the cross. Not a high-risk maneuver, but slightly risky. Trying to keep the ball here and risk losing it in the defensive third. Looked very good indeed, but the move has broken down. Good position. They've worked this attack very well. Into quite a dangerous position now. Wabi Qazri. Sassi. Toby Alderweireld. Hazard. Now, this looks promising. It's De Bruyne. De Bruyne. It's De Bruyne. De Bruyne. You can see what he was trying to do. Passed it into the net, but passed it off target. Well off target. He's gone back, the referee, to book the offence. and he let the play go on. It was good work by the official, but he's quite entitled to book the player now. Well, he's always going to get a yellow for that, wasn't he? It was a silly challenge, and yes, you play advantage, but he's got to be punished for it. Hazard. Sassi. Getting forward well as a team now. Challenges for the ball. Jan Vertonghen. Kevin de Bruyne. And a pass not completed, really. Sassi. Well, he's pressed him there to running the ball out of play. Axel Witzel. On the move and able to cut out the pass. Good defending. Here's Mertens. Attacking now. The target, Hazard. Hassen makes the save look easy. Keep possession with that header. Hazard. Good strong tackle. Got the ball, and they're going at the opposition with speed. The opposition read the back heel. Romelu Lukaku. He's caught offside, and you see what he's trying to do. It's all about the timing of the run. He goes a bit early, gets a bit too eager. Maria. Malou. Kovacic. Quick-witted, and quick in his movement too, to intercept there. Eden Hazard. On to the attack now. Malou. Axel Witzel. Here's Carrasco. That's very good shielding of the ball. Promising build-up until that challenge. Kevin de Bruyne. Axel Witzel. They continue to defend as a unit, but no real attacking outlet, so the game is being played in their half. Mertens. And shoots! Two in front now. Well, keep the concentration, and they've won this match, I think. It's a very good goal. I think they were a bit caught out, because that's supposed to be his weaker foot, and they kind of just switched off for a moment. Yeah, look at the way he did take it. Maybe he's been working on that weaker side on the training ground. Restarting at 2-0. Lukaku. He screened the ball well there. Meunier. And the referee has given the free-kick. De Bruyne. At least pissed away by the keeper. De Bruyne. Stopped emphatically, and just as well. The approach play looked very encouraging. Kevin de Bruyne. Thomas Meunier. And there is some backup for him in this position. Tackle goes in. Ben Youssef. Malou. And they've cut it out. With Mertens. Played forward. A bit of menace in this attack. Taking on the defenders. Cut off! They've scored! Wonderful strike. And the spectacular nature of the goal really. They've scored! Wonderful strike. And the spectacular nature of the goal reflected in the replay here. Important moment. Maybe the most important moment in the match. They shouldn't be caught from here, should they Alan? I don't think so. There'll be questions asked if they are. To be honest with you Martin, the opposition looks down and out down there. I don't think we expected this. Such a one-sided affair. But look at the scoreline. Sassy. Malou. Malou. There's a dangerous feel to this attack. It's looking good from their point of view. Max Helwitzel. Bit of space to go forward into with the ball. The shot's on! Goalkeeper hangs on. Attacking now. And it's shut off now. From nowhere near. No, he's miscued that one. Miscued it badly. Max Helwitzel. Nice return pass. Mertens. Cut out by the defender. Here's a chance to attack. Into the box it goes. Along the ground. Mernier. Max Helwitzel. Mertens. Well, they're in a good position here. Tries the cross here. Carrasco. Oh, that's good defending. Chance for a teammate now. And here's the shot. The scorer for Belgium. Who else? Lukaku. Oh, his movement and touch there was first class. Well, scoring in any game is worthy of celebration. When you get two, it is special. And he is feeling that special delight at the moment. And here is another angle on that goal. I have to say it's so one-sided today but all credit to the team that are racking up You can see the deflection there, corner. Alan which have you made of Lukaku who's too hot to handle at the moment for the opposition? Well you've only got to look at the screen to see how successful, how positive he's been around goal. He's been so effective and got on the score sheet as well, superb performance. De Bruyne's delivery, the goalkeeper comes out with a punch. He'll get a free kick for that. The referee obviously allowed them to take that quickly. Cleared away, well away from goal. De Bruyne. Promising build-up until that challenge. Chance to go at the opposition with pace. Mertens. Here's Mertens. Looked very good indeed but the move has broken down. Now Dries Mertens. A low ball into the box. Very good distance to the clearance. Badri. He's got some strength hasn't he to shield the ball like that. Makso Vidsok. Attacking well here. Can he pick somebody out with this pull-back? He's put it over. But here they are on the attack. Azar. Did well. Stuck out of foot. Cut off the pass. The referee has communicated to the fourth official there'll be five added minutes. He went in well. Now Dries Mertens. A dangerous piece of defending really. Under some pressure straight away. He can cross it now. Well he can do this Kevin De Bruyne. He can really get at the opposition. And they've cut it out. Well the wide man can show his skills here. On the move and able to cut out the pass. Kevin De Bruyne. Good defending. Guabi Khazri. On the attack here. Oh it could be off. They've got it into score here. He can't have scored many better than this. With the bend he's imparted onto the ball. I'll give him credit. You could see exactly what he set out to do there and executed it perfectly. So we restart again 4-1. Kevin De Bruyne. Kevin De Bruyne. Axel Witzel. Now they've got a chance in this part of the pitch. Whipped in ball at the keepers ball. No question about that. It's a weak cross really. Kevin De Bruyne. So there we are. Half time. Well what a player. What a performance in that first half Alan. On top of his game out there and I'm sure he'll be thinking about grabbing his hat trick in the second half. A chance. It's bounced back into play from the bar. Could be a chance here. They've got the ball into a good area. Opportunity here. Mertens. A chance. Two in front now. Well keep the concentration and they've won this match I think. Taking on the defenders. Shot on. Well that's good defending. Chance for a team mate now. Here's the shot. On the attack here. Oh it could be up. He's got his shot off now. They've got him to score here. You don't often get a first half as one sided as this one. They've been very good. The team that are leading of course. And the ball goes out for a goal kick. I just wonder whether the occasion is getting the better of them. We really expected a bit more so far. Well you know what they say. If you don't buy a ticket you won't win the raffle. And we can see from that graphic that he's just not testing the keeper enough to have any success and his team are losing too. Kevin De Bruyne. Eden Hazard. Now Dries Mertens trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. Jan Vertonghen. Kevin De Bruyne. That's great defending there. Stopping that attack. Slity. Good position. They've worked this attack very well into a quite a dangerous position now. It's not a cross that's caused the defence any problems and certainly not the goalkeeper. Meunier. Max Ovitzel. Schalala. Could be a chance here. They've got the ball into a good area. Good strong tackle. Mertens. Guiding the pass through. He's in. Well that was so close to going inside the post but it's just straight past the outside. Yeah I think he's beaten the keeper you know but just not got it within the framework of the goals and he's a bit unlucky. Cagliari. Kevin De Bruyne. Meunier. It's good movement forward here. That's a good spot by the defender. And that will be offside. Flag went up. And the managers decided for a change of personnel. That's a combination of skill and will to hold off the opposition. Not a very active way of playing this for the defending team because they're not... Shot's on here. He's reached it and turned it aside. Put into the middle. It was put into the right area but no one able to reach the cross. He's read that, hasn't he, and made the interception. Made it look easy actually. Getting the ball back and thinking attack straight away. Sassi. That's very good shielding of the ball. Moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here. Return pass. He's got some strength, hasn't he, to shield the ball like that. Attacking now. Ben Youssef. Got to keep the ball here under some pressure. Sassi. Wabi Qazri. Using his physical power to protect the ball. Slity. Played forward. A bit of menace in this attack. Keepers ball. No question about that. It was a weak cross really. Headed pass then and a shrewd one. Wabi Qazri. The limit goes. Good defensive clearance there. Here's Mertens. Mertens. It was good progress with this attack. Maybe the cross. Here comes the support. And that's a foul and they'll get a free kick for that. The manager is going to bring on a fresh player now. Cleared away, well away from goal. Axel Witzel. Lukaku. Another shot. Super goal. Yes, it's a goal from the substitute. And he's quickly made his mark on proceedings here. Sometimes those kind of shots do come and back out off the crossbar. Not this time. What a goal. They are playing well. Their superiority increased really with this goal. Well, you can only see more goals coming their way, the way they play. Oh, they want to see this again, this goal. The player who's been carrying a yellow card is now going to be taken off. They don't want to risk a red. I don't think we expected this, such a one-sided affair. But look at the scoreline. He's lent the ball to his mate and got it back again. Gets his cross in. Axel Witzel. Thomas Meunier. He's coming forward with some danger. Some options now for the pass. Fellaini. He's screened the ball well there. Tackle here. Under some pressure, he's shielded it well. Zouabi Kazri. That's a combination. Fouled by company. He's going to make a change now. That's very good shielding of the ball. Trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. Well, this could lead to a goal if he loses the ball. An opponent around him. That's good screening of the football. Good screening. And he's kept the ball. Well, they're in a good position here. A little private game between the two of them. And shoots! And Hassen makes the save look easy. Now, this is an interesting attack. You don't see that so often. Just glided past him effortlessly. This might be it! And he knocks in the goal. I think a manager loves that kind of goal because it's a real team effort the way they move the ball about. And once it came to the finish, it was an unerring effort. Well, they've increased their lead here. And that could just wrap up the match. Yeah, the much better team out here today. And that scoreline reflects that. The goal, wherever you look at it, it was very well taken. One team really on their game today. The other very off-colour. Using his physical power to protect the ball. A couple of teammates who are clearly on the same wavelength. He's got some strength, hasn't he, to shield the ball like that. Proper tackle, that. Ben Amor. It's a raffle. A little piece of interplay between the two. There's good progress with this attack. He's got his shot off now! Hit the post! Thomas Merlier. I think the wide man's got a chance here. There's space out near the touchline. It's aimed for Mertens. Well, that's good defending. Just read the intentions of the opposition there to make the interception. Really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now. Delivered into the box. Well, the goalkeeper will hope that it stays like that throughout the game. Done well under pressure here to hold the guided through. He's on the move all the time and makes lots of these interceptions. A dangerous piece of defending, really. Under some pressure straight away. Now, company. Axel Witzel. Romelu Lukaku. He's screened the ball well there. Getting forward well as a team now. Chialalli. Wabi Qazri. Treads it through. It's an excellent cross. Fellaini into the attacking third and opponents around him that's good screening of the football Thomas Murnier, Torgan Hazard, Fellaini it goes, Slity, attacking now, came in with a challenge and the ball broke free. He couldn't get down quickly enough to deal with such a low and effective shot. Well he's not far out but you've got to be on your toes in these circumstances and he was. He looked the goalkeeper in the eyes and said right I've got the win here and he's got the goal to show that. I love that kind of finish when you don't have to blast it as long as the placement is right. And we're getting into the realms of crazy scorelines now 6-2. Sometimes being a favourite in a match can weigh heavily expectation and all that. It's not a problem for this team is it? No I think their manager will be delighted because they've not taken it easily at all. They've given respect to their opponents but they've shown the class too. Played down the wing keeping the wide attack going. Torgan Hazard under some pressure he's shielded it well. Now the shot. Given that he tried to place it he got it rather wrong. Yeah probably did choose the wrong option should have tried to get some power behind that shot. Good forward play from them. Good strong tackle. Plenty of power but not too much direction. It is going to be a change here and it looks like a strategic one. Here's Carrasco. Attacking well here. It'll be a throw. Romelu Lukaku. Good defensive clearance there. And here's the shot. You see what he was trying to do opening up his body to place it but he's placed it wide sadly for him. They spread it out wide here. Chance to get some width into this attack. Delivered into the box. Romelu Lukaku. Done well under pressure here to hold the ball as the challenge came in. Dembele. Moussa Dembele. It's looking good this move. Cagliari. He's screened the ball well there. We like to see this from a referee playing the advantage. It goes out wide again. Salahlu. Serafi. Maybe the cross. The marking's really poor. He's got a chance. Corner kick coming up. Well played the referee. He's gone back to the offense that deserved a bookie. He didn't want to stop the play at the time and he's quite entitled to do what he's doing here. Yeah I think we all thought he was going to go back but good to see advantage being played. Put the corner in the middle. He's got his shot off now. A real miscue here. A little headed pass then and a shrewd one. This could lead to a chance. It's good attacking play. It's always a pleasure to score a goal but in these circumstances it's probably the minimum amount of pleasure that you get. It's a goal. It's something to take with them as the final whistle goes in a few moments that they have scored right on the end of the game here. Right on the final whistle but not much more than that. No Martin. A bad day at the office all round and plenty of work for the manager to do on that training ground. Well this is what we love about football. A goal fest and we're getting it in this game in abundance. That goes down on his record as a goal at this division and he'll be pleased with scoring that but for the general outcome it's got scant influence on that. No none at all. I actually think the winning manager will be annoyed in that dressing room afterwards because he won a thoroughly professional job and you know they just let themselves down there. Well then it goes. Good clearance. The team is lining up for the corner. There's no criticism from these supporters. They've enjoyed what they've seen today and it doesn't always pan out that way. Being a football supporter can be quite hard yards. Well it can indeed. So you've got to enjoy the good times and today has been one of those occasions. And in it goes. Turned aside there by the keeper. This is a good opportunity to put the ball into the penalty area now. Whipped in from the wide area. Comes out with a punch to clear the danger. And that is the end. It's all over. Well there's nothing really at stake here Alan Isner but even so to win by this kind of margin is very satisfying. Well it is. They looked a little sharper, a little fitter and the losing team certainly got a lot of work to do before they get up to match speed. So taking on the defenders. On the attack here. Oh, it could be on. It's already shut off now. And they've got him to score here. Max Orwitzel. Lukaku. Another shot! You don't see that so often. Just glided past him effortlessly. This might be it! And he knocks in the goal. In with the challenge and the ball broke free. Shut off! This could lead to a chance. It's good attacking play. Glided through. Real opening for him."}]}

My first World Cup, Alan, as a commentator, 1978 in Argentina. Won by Argentina. And I'll never forget the outpourings of joy from the local fans at that triumph. Yeah, the ticker tape. Mario Kempis, Ozzy Ardiles. Great times for the country. Starting 11 now for Argentina. Nicolas Otamendi plays with Federico Fazio as the centre-backs. Lucas Pilia plays with Eivor Benego in the engine room. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn is the sole striker today. Iceland have this line-up at their disposal today. Gilpi Sigurdsson starts alongside Aaron Gunnarsson in the middle of the park. And it's rounded off the team with these two strikers. What we've been waiting for, the kick-off, the game is underway. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. And here's some attacking play from Argentina. Benega chops on here. Superb save. He shouldn't have had a chance at all with that. What about those reflexes? Brilliant. Taken by Messi. Very good distance to the clearance. And then he goes with the tackle. Mercado. Benega. Messi. Di Maria. Well, I've all gone to the defender to say well done. But I think the guy who had the chance really should have scored. Well, he had the chance to get his shots away. Even though he had to take it quickly. Should have done better. Good work, really, to read the intention of the pass. Filia. Rojo. It's Argentina attacking here. Gilfi Sigurdsson. J\u00fcrgen B\u00f6gersen. Bjarnason. No reason to stop the game for the referee then. And he's read the play well. He's got his shot off now. Right from the kick-off. It looked like scoring they had now. Sharp from the off. And what a good goal. Well, he took it on, didn't he, the shot? That had a go first time into the net. He did take a chance. When you hit them first time like that, the keeper doesn't get a chance really quite often to get set. And that was the case here. So the first goal. It's 1-0. Filia. On towards Messi. Getting forward well as a team now. And here's the shot. Difficult skill. Good effort. Yeah, timed it perfectly. As you have to do with those volleys. How he missed it, Alan. I really don't know how he missed it. I think he was planning his celebration before he'd actually touched the ball. Got ahead of himself there. Yeah, that's great defending there. Stopping that attack. Turn pass. An attack from Argentina. Rojo. Higuain. Messi. That's the way to defend. Make sure the opposition can't get on the ball in that part of the pitch. Filia. Switch of emphasis. Going inside. Please cut that out. Well, well read. David Benavida. And here's some attacking play from Argentina. Gonzalo Higuain. That's a combination of skill and will to hold off the opposition. Di Maria. Challenges for the ball. Slipped through. Pjanas. Oh, they could have increased their advantage then. Yeah, I think that would have been game over. It should have been really from that distance. Filia. Now Messi. It's Argentina attacking here. Mercado. Klappel has changed the emphasis of this passage of play. They're on the front foot now. Stopped emphatically and just as well. The approach play looked very encouraging. Filia. Here's a chance to attack. Now Messi. Just let the ball to his mate and got it back again. Tim Bogerson. That's a turnover of possession here. Filia. And he could get away here. And shoots! Well, they've all gone to the defender to say well done. But I think the guy who had the chance really should have scored. Well, he had the chance to get his shot away. Even though he had to take it quickly. Should have done better. Mercado. Gunnarsson. I think he saw the look from the other player and saw where the pass was going and read it. Well, here's an opportunity with the ball over the top. Eva Banega She's got some strength hasn't she, to shield the ball like that Quite clearly a free kick Angel Di Maria, well he's got support here Higuain Giannis Wigmundsen Nicolas Otamendi That's relieved some of the pressure as the defender clears his lines out of play Gonzalo Higuain Banega, back with Higuain Di Maria Higuain Banega Pull it back here, set up a chance Bodvarsen Gylfi Sigurdsson Giannis Good position, they've worked this attack very well Into quite a dangerous position now The shot's on! Struck the post here Goodmundsen Shot's on here Threw everything behind that shot And frustrated that it wasn't quite on target If he keeps getting in those kind of areas I'm sure he'll score pretty soon It's an abject Argentina at the moment Comfort for their supporters is they can't continue to play as badly as this surely Maybe just the way they went into the game Perhaps a bit too complacent But they need to shake themselves out of it if they're going to get anything from the game Di Maria Tackle here Javier Mascherano Eva Banega Giannis It's Messi Eva Banega Javier Mascherano We're looking for a couple of killer passes here from the attacking team Against defenders that are really earning their money The whole team is defending And here's some attacking play from Argentina Mercado Lionel Messi Return ball Messi puts it into the box Goalkeeper will get this one no problem Javier Mascherano Mercado Two oohs around the crowd for a three minute add-on Which is what we're going to get for added time Di Maria When he gets a goal like Di Maria It's usually a special one And that's certainly the case this time And here he was faced by the goalkeeper That was the challenge In you go Easy as you like It looks easy doesn't it But I can tell you it's not You have to be at the top of your game to try and to convert it Di Maria So away we go at one all Gylfi Sigurdsson Wigmundsson Wigmundsson Comes in with a tackle Everything to play for in the second half We've reached half time at 1-1 And Angel Di Maria Has lit up the first 45 minutes Well really good late equalising goal And that might just change the manager's team talk now Wigmundsson Van Ager Shots on him No reason to stop the game for the referee then He's read the play well He's got his shot off now Getting forward well as a team now And here's the shot Back off the post Good position They've worked this attack very well Into quite a dangerous position now The shot's on Struck the post here Two oohs around the crowd for a three minute add on Which is what we're going to get for added time Di Maria Wigmundsson Second half to start now And it's Argentina to do just that And here they are on the attack He can lay it off to the supporting player Rojo Stopped emphatically and just as well The approach play looks very encouraging Good effort Giannis They could pose some danger now Wigmundsson Has to clear it Eva Van Ager Lionel Messi Wigmundsson Trying a bit too hard trying to force the pass And it went straight to an opponent Fed away by the defender Eva Van Ager Higuain That's a brilliant challenge Rojo Eva Van Ager Higuain Now with Bigley Di Maria And here's the shot It's a goal to put them in front Can they defend this lead now? He took it with greater plumb I'm sure getting the first goal gave him The confidence to grab the second chance here Different angle on it here Argentina Argentina ready to Use a substitute The lead then with Argentina Gunnarsson Gunnarsson They saw the guy could switch the play to And came up with the pass as well Excellent Could be a chance here. They've got the ball into a good area. Promising build-up until that challenge. Gunnarsson. Bob Barca. Filip. Angel Di Maria. An attack from Argentina. Rojo. Seeking Messi in the middle. There's still danger here after this half-clearance. Just read the intentions of the opposition there to make the interception. Here goes Messi. He's got his shot off now. Clipped over the bar by the keeper. This is where managers really earn their money. In a losing situation, they've got to make a substitution. Got to get it right, really, to have any chance of getting anything from the match. Here comes the corner. Shots on here. Full on the frame of the goal. Defended well. But he took no chances there. Back to corner. Very good effort earlier, wasn't there, Alan? Here it is. A little bit wild in terms of technique. Tried to place it, but body shape was all wrong. Good defensive clearance there. He could lay it off to the supporting player. That's a fine challenge. And he's got the ball. Good Munson. Woodvarsen. Tim Brogerson. Shot off! Chance for his second goal of the match. The goalkeeper determined not to be beaten a second time. Yeah, I think he was disappointed how he got beaten the first. So, made a next step. Getting forward well as a team now. Supporting player alongside. Lanzini. Now with Biglia. Higuain. Gilfi Sigurdsson. Tim Brogerson. That's a foul by the Argentina man. But they're still leading. And they've decided to go for a fresh player. In the hope of hanging on to that lead. Lanzini. This could be danger to the opposition from Higuain. Fibala. Messi. Oh, a Messi offside here. Stopped in his tracks. Well, the manager will be delighted with the way his team have played so far. But he's going to make a substitution here. Just to hope that he can retain this lead. Higuain. Now this looks promising. That's great defending there, stopping that attack. Gonzalo Higuain. Lanzini. Mercado. He was in the right place at the right time to cut it out. He's got some room out here in the wide position. Another shot! That's a good block. And here they are on the attack. Biglia. Lanzini. Gonazza. Gilfi Sigurdsson. It's not a cross that's caused the defence any problems. And certainly not the goalkeeper. Well, we're not quite at the end yet for Argentina to celebrate a comeback victory. That's what's looming large for them after that dismal first half showing. Throw-in for Argentina. And that's what substitutes the four to be used. And we've got one coming on now. Dybala. Now this could be a problem for the opposition. Dybala's coming at them at pace. Could really get a... Here's the chance! Real miscue here. On the attack here. Good Munson. He's got his shot off now. Not far away at all. Well, if they keep creating chances, I'm sure they'll take one. That was a decent effort, you know. Right from the beginning, we never know which way this game is going to go. And it's kept its drama right to the last. Turn-pass. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. Well, this attack... Could have been a menace to it. He's trying forward, purposefully. Argentina have conceded a free-kick here. Just a change now. He's bringing on a new player. Still danger here. After this half clearance. Pressed high here. There's some potential in this move. And it's a goal. Lanzini. And the fourth official has held up the ball to play four more minutes. He's doing the ball well there. Spotted that well, and intercepted. The opponents around him, that's good screening of the football. Di Maria. This is how the game, many people believe, should be played. It's always been a passing game. But they've passed with purpose, slipping it through. In with a chance. Can finish it off. For Barca. Goal. CHEERING That is textbook from him. That's all about anticipation and just snapping up the rebound. You can see a slightly different viewpoint on it. Two teams brilliantly matched in this contest. It's level again. After 90 minutes, the scores are level. No reason to stop the game for the referee then, and he's read the play well. He's got his shot off now. Two oohs around the crowd for a three-minute add-on, which is what we're going to get for added time. Now with big lip. Di Maria, and here's the shot. There's a goal to put them in front. Can they defend this lead now? Here goes Messi. He's got his shot off now. Picked over the bar by the keeper. That's good support play. Shot's on here. Full on the frame of the goal. In with a chance to finish it off. For Barca."}]}

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today we have a match of global interest for you, it's Barcelona against Real Madrid and I'm Martin Tyler, Alan Smith is with me and what hasn't been said that's been said a million times about this game, it's thrilling Alan. It is, you look at those two teams down there, the superstars, the sheer depth of talent in both and it really disappoints, does it? Well Lionel Messi, it's such a privilege to watch him play. Well he's got the ball on a string hasn't he, I mean he's mesmeric to watch, can't get enough of him. Always feel watching Real Madrid, Alan, that it is every kid's dream to come and join them, it's a wonderful reputation for attracting the best young talent when they come to the four and other countries. Just something magical about that all white kid, as a kid I would dream of playing for this side and any lad is the same. Barcelona's line up here, well we know Alan how they like to play with plenty of possession and some short passes, expecting exactly the same from them here? Well you'd imagine so wouldn't you, that is their default setting as it were and as the opposition you've got to stay so organised and you've got to work so hard, it's not a game you look forward to really. This is the Real Madrid line up, it's a real group mentality in this line up about pressing the opposition into making mistakes and cashing in on it straight away. It takes a lot of energy, a lot of motivation, it's easy to drop off and when you do drop off that really aggressive closing down, that's when it can fall down. And El Clasico is underway. Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic, Coutinho, Dembele, Luis Su\u00e1rez, good stop by the goalkeeper. Marco Asensio, striding forward purposefully, trying to lift it over the nearest defender and he couldn't. A bit of space to go forward into with the ball, in the middle it's Coutinho, keeper's ball, no question about that, it's a weak cross really. Gareth Bale where he can do some damage here out wide. That's great work by the goalkeeper. Coutinho, Luis Su\u00e1rez, doing well to keep the ball and that's good support as they build this attack. Coutinho, Su\u00e1rez here, defender has to be quick, Modric, Toni Kroos, Marcelo, it's with Marco Asensio. It's going to be a real target for victory for Real Madrid here and if they don't get should be able to achieve their goals. Su\u00e1rez, he's way off target. Quick witted and quick in his movement too to intercept there. Marcelo, Toni Kroos, here's Casemiro, guiding the pass through. Marco Asensio, Sergio Roberto, Luis Su\u00e1rez, now Casemiro, Coutinho. They can be quick on the break now. Kept the ball but the counter attack was the chance you felt and it just faded away. Sergio Ramos clears it here. Dembele, could have got through there but the defender was absolutely on top of his game. Modric, Marco Asensio, shots on here, good work by the goalkeeper. Dembele, well the wide man can show his skills here. This turnover could be costly against a side that can break like this. That'll run straight through to the goalkeeper. Marcelo, here's Casemiro. Ivan Rakitic, free kick conceded by him. A yellow card, Alan. Yeah, quite right. Was that just a case of mistiming the tackle? Didn't look comfortable going into it and it was a definite foul. Cut out by Sergio Busquets. The shot's off. Oh, it's awesome. It's attacking strength and they've got a lead again. And they'll be feeling they're going to head for victory again. Such a difficult thing to score on a regular basis at this level of football. But they have found the answer. They've got the formula. Well, they call it his weaker side. Too weak that. Didn't look that way, did it Martin? He took a little chance there and he's really been rewarded for it. Well, they'll want to see this again, this goal. Good news for Barcelona, they lead. Modric. Barcelona know enough about this big ship that being in front at this stage with half-time approaching is no guarantee. Yeah, it's not a big margin, is it? He's got his shot off now. Corner now for Barcelona. Coutinho's corner. The goalkeeper takes charge here from the corner. Coutinho. Dembele. Backwards. Coutinho! That's easy for Courtois. Luis Suarez. Saw the ball, went for it. Kroos. Marsella. across leaving the pass looking good this move couldn't keep it Tony Kroos Modric Bale he's gone into some traffic but it could be dangerous here for the opposition read the play well shot blocked here Bale, Tony Kroos Bale here's a chance to go keep him exposed so it's one nil here as the halftime whistle go well the player that we're featuring here has done well he's certainly been an influence on this first half well he played really well didn't he and he got himself a goal to put his team ahead he'll be pleased with that first 45 minutes and el clasico is underway so well this is the second half now and it's underway Kroos just working away to try and find an opening Sergio Busquets Luis Suarez now it's Ousmane Dembele it's offside Modric Bale a chance plenty of power but not too much direction now it's Ousmane Dembele Jordi Alba here's Busquets and now they're two up with another fine piece of attacking play typical really of the work of the players and the effort that they put in on the training ground the manager has got terrific belief in attacking football and he must be thrilled probably beyond even his wildest dreams they attack they score they attack they score that's the kind of team they are they score they attack they score that's the kind of team they are but if you keep going in to that sort of area the ball will drop for you and it dropped perfectly for him that's the lesson to anybody uh in doing a goal keep getting into the positions in the 18 yard in the six yard box and you will score just widen the margin here to two nil so happy in possession Tony Kroos and his team are happy when he's got the ball as well yeah makes this side tick could be a chance here they've got the ball into a good area Lionel Messi Karim Benzema great interception time for Real Madrid to just tinker with the team a bit with a substitution Coutinho intercepted well now this is an interesting attack referee sees that as a foul and it is a free kick well there's going to be an alteration now and with the team trailing you can understand why he's going to make it he's normally good from these set plays and his teammates are expecting a good ball in Marco Asensio it's Modric well that just shimmers with quality doesn't it Modric what a take important for them to get the next goal and they've got it and they're still in the contest well there's an opportunity for the winning team to shut up shop but i'm not sure they're capable of it the goal wherever you look at it it was very well taken so and we restart the game 2-1 Ivan Rakitic, Luis Suarez Pique building steadily here keeping possession now it's swung shots off that's a good block and the ball knocked away long Jordi Alba Coutinho, Rakitic, the shots off well he's skimmed the top of the bar here I think the keeper was probably comfortable but decent effort it's his goal Toni Kroos Real Madrid looking good here just read the intentions of the opposition there to make the interception still 20 minutes to go Ivan Rakitic, Piquinho Suarez here can really get at the opposition here Suarez the ball's loose goalkeeper made the save but he couldn't hold it cleared away by the goalkeeper Real Madrid will make the substitution now now Casemiro it's Messi and that will end the threat at least for the moment activity on the bench for the losing team a substitute getting ready to come on Messi, Sergi Roberto, Ivan Rakitic, Coutinho he's got the ball back well the defender keeping the ball is one way to manage this situation for Barcelona they're pretty good at that trying to protect this advantage against Real great ball from Bale for Real Madrid increasing frustration here they continue to trail but they should have been level they certainly should have it wasn't a difficult chance is it going to be one of those days the manager seems to think so look at his expression what a chance miss that was to go level measured composed in control Barcelona not really hurried out of their relaxed and stylish stride and they're going to get the success that they thoroughly merit that's a serious situation and on he goes there's still danger here after this half clearance and on the clock eight more minutes keeping an eye on the time here we still could have a decisive moment in the short time that remains now the shot and he's done it well what a guy this is turning out to be from two behind And now level again. Real Madrid have drawn level. It looks as though they were going to lose, but they've just not given up on it. No, and the way the last five minutes have gone, you could see it coming. We can see a slightly different viewpoint on it. The game restarts at 2-2. Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi. Messi, shots on him. Referee's given the corner, and the chance now to call men forward. Taken by Messi. Pass line to get the throw. Now it's Ousmane Dembele. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. Now it's Ousmane Dembele. They've got the ball back by that interception. Gareth Bale. The number's gone up. As far as added time is concerned, it's four. Yeah, and there's a sense of anticipation within this ground. They think they've got a decent enough chance now to do the necessary. Real Madrid is still on the attack in the closing moments here. It's still... Shots on! Here's Isco. Marcelo. And he's a free kick. Cleared away, well away from goal. And time ticking away. There is the final whistle. The team's still level here after 90 minutes. Well, we're all level after 90 minutes, so it's on to extra time. It's underway. Coutinho. Sergio Busquets. And now Messi. Sergio Roberto. Messi. He's tried that from long range. He's tried that from long range. It's not really going to get the better of him from that range, especially when he can see it all the way. Lucas Vasquez. Toni Kroos. Marcelo. Now Casimiro. Marcelo! Coutinho. Dembele. Bit of space for him. Now out on the wing. To put them in front. Jordi Alba. Dembele. Dembele! Here's a chance to get their noses in front from the corner. In goes the corner. Keeper might be needed again. He didn't hang on to the ball. He spotted the pass and cut it out. Luis Suarez. Tidy work from Barcelona. They might have played him in here. That's the referee's decision. The shot's off! Really hit well, but didn't trouble the goalkeeper. Yeah, maybe a little sighter for him there. There's going to be some activity from the bench for Barcelona. Second period of extra time to come. And still the chance that penalties might decide it all here. The teams have turned around quickly. And the second period of extra time underway straight away. Isco couldn't hold on to the ball. Vidal. I think the wide man's got a chance here. There's space out near the touchline. Isco. Isco. Isco. Isco. Isco. He's read that, hasn't he? And made the interception. Made it look easy, actually. He's going to try his luck! Turned away by the goalkeeper spectacularly. Barcelona winning a corner. Dangerous ball in from Messi. Good clearance from Sergio Ramos. And shoots! Corner now, Barcelona. Corner's taken. Now Casemiro. Toni Kroos. Kroos. Well defended. Not just getting across. He thought quickly as well. And here's the shot! Oh, it's awesome! It's attacking strength and they've got a lead again. And they'll be feeling they're going to head for victory again. Such a difficult thing to score on a regular basis at this level of football. But they have found the answer. They've got the formula. Not scoring in any game is worthy of celebration. When you get to, it is special. And he is feeling that special delight at the moment. Real Madrid have gone behind in this game. Still seven minutes to go in the second half of extra time. Toni Kroos. Well, we've had some chances, Alan. But it's a while since we've had a goal. They've still got the lead. Yeah, they're knocking the ball about with a fair bit of confidence. And they look pretty secure with this lead at the moment. Messi! How to play for a throw. And they've thrown the ball away there. Literally to the opposition. Made away, well away from goal. Two minutes left in the second half of extra time. Here's Casemiro. It's one back. Praise for trying the shot, Alan. Well, his teammates aren't too happy. Look for a moment as though that might be challenging the goalkeeper. But he's able to win. watch it go over the bar. A bit over ambitious I think and some of his teammates are telling him that. And the time to be added on here is a minimum of three minutes crafting the through pass. Very straightforward piece of goalkeeping as he catches the cross. That's the win for Barcelona. That was breathtaking. Attack after attack. You see this kind of game once every 10 times and we've been privileged to be here. you"}]}

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's a friendly between two countries that have a real rivalry, no love lost between them at all. And we should expect, Alan, a firecracker of a match. I think so. Two giants of the world game and so many fantastic talents in both of these sides. And this match is Brazil against Argentina. We talk about the highest level that a player can achieve, Alan, you had the honour of playing for England and we've got two national teams here today. It's always a special moment, you pull on your nation's shirt. Always a big game. This is no different. Brazil's line-up today is this. We've got it down as a 4-3-3. Yeah, it's a system that the Netherlands used to use all the time. I think really they invented it and plenty of countries have adopted it since. If it works, it's really tough to handle. They certainly know how to pay tribute here at Old Trafford to great names of the past. We're looking across at the Alec Ferguson stand from the Bobby Charlton stand. Yeah, it's a marvellous theatre, no doubt. And I'm sure when they're trying to attract players, they only have to show them round Old Trafford and their case has been won. Argentina with this line-up. Sergio Romero plays in goal, in attack Lionel Messi partners up with Mauro Icardi. Here we go with Brazil getting us underway. He can lay it off to the supporting player. He's going to tie his luck. Big start, really quick off the blocks here. And they've given themselves a terrific boost for what lies ahead. Well you get a lot of satisfaction as a goal scoring forward for knocking one in from that distance. You know you're in the right place. Yeah, it was a poacher's effort. The final finish wasn't difficult. But to get there, it took a little bit of instinct. Brazil have the lead. Here's Icardi. My first World Cup, Alan, as a commentator. 1978 in Argentina, won by Argentina. Good vision. The chance did open up for that kind of shot. Don't ever go. Neymar. Neymar. A chance. Brazil have a corner. In from Neymar. Not really away from the threat here. Neymar. Tackle here. Paredes. Nicolas Otamendi. They gave it straight to him, didn't they? That's very well cut out at an important time. Just cleared downfield. Not a proper pass because the pressure is so intense. Opening them up with a through pass. Can go in from here. Got to keep the ball here under some pressure. He's going to trust his goalkeeper's footwork here with a back pass. Neymar. He's one-on-one with the goalkeeper. That's really the way to get the ball out of the danger zone. Icardi. Paredes. Now it's back with Brazil. Excellent vision. And it goes for the chip. Just wide of the target. Icardi. Cut it out. Good work. Neymar. Strong, powerful clearance. Never quite as simple as you think to throw the ball to one of your teammates. Now Messi. Attacking well here. Striding forward purposefully. Icardi. And it's an equaliser for them. Well the equaliser has happened. Took perhaps the opposition by surprise. But we're level again. It's what they've deserved. Well it's a goal worth replaying over and over again, isn't it? So away we go at one all. They're pretty well matched up for this game. So they know they're going to have to play to their full potential. And that potential of course is awesome. Lovely ball. Needs to stay cool now. Up for grabs. Well they managed to get out of harm's way there. Because it looked as though there was going to be some real damage done to them. To put them in front. Oh what a tackle to break up the play. Well they have cleared the danger. It was a decent opportunity I think. Herrera. Here's Messi. Shot's on here. Tried for his second goal of the game. Thwarted by the keeper this time. Yeah and that's a good stop. He stayed on his toes. Good reactions. Gone short with the corner. Messi. And there's the goal. Well for all of you who love seeing headed goals, I do for sure. I know Alan does. What a good example this was. Well it wasn't just about the quality of header. That was good enough. But the movement that allowed him to find that space. That was the good bit. Didn't he get it right? The leap. The plotting of the trajectory as the ball came in. And the contact with the head. Well when you can do that. When you can jump like he can. He's such a strong player. Very hard to stop. Well Brazil are trailing. Neymar. Could be dangerous. I think the cross is off. It's not a cross that's caused the defence any problems. And certainly not the goal. goalkeeper certainly wanting to find a teammate but he's just found an opponent throw in for Argentina Custos loses possession trying to stretch the opposition using the wider areas here it's not really a way for clearance Icardi Nicolas Otamendi three minutes from the referee via the fourth official that's the decision regarding added time keeper might be needed again he didn't hang on to the ball fabulous clearance that is the equalizing goal a goal from Neymar and well that's evaded the keeper's grasp a really good finish from him well let's take another look at the goal so extraordinary game here two very well matched teams and they're trading goal for goal in the game so we're halfway through here at Old Trafford the second half is underway it's Messi Lionel Messi guiding it through looks the goalkeeper in the eye far too close across to the keeper so a chance to break away now on the counter what about Neymar in the first half Alan well really good late equalizing goal and that might just change the manager's team talk now I like the look of this attack and here's the shot that's a good block had to come back into his own half to get hold of possession here so short passes but they're keeping the ball that's proper clearance well away from the danger zone Argentina ready to use a substitute Neymar room for the cross he's got his shot off now and that's good play by the defender because had he messed up then it would have cost a goal I'm sure Neymar now corner for Brazil Neymar on the set piece the corner put them in front but he saved it on the line that'll be another corner coming up Neymar's corner defended well well how defensive have they become at the moment they're sitting in their own half and having the opposition pass the ball around in front of them maybe they feel they're not going to be hurt shots on here and that is quite a wild effort at goal although you've got good contact on the ball it's another decent try but we're still levelling this match it's going to be a change here for Argentina so he's got some room out here in the wide position Dybala pressed and won the ball well forward saw the goal and went for it that is one of the great saves had no right to stop that had no right to get a hand on it what a stop it's Brazil breaking forward must take the lead here which they do in good style now they played some good football leading up to that Martin had thoroughly deserved that goal well they all count the same but he won't ever get an easier one no I don't think so that he was there right place at the right time let's see the replay now so what's the reaction going to be from Argentina to the fact that they're now trailing Nicolas Otamendi now Messi Dybala it's a good way to nick the ball back quick thinking Dybala I think the wide man's got a chance here there's space out near the touchline so we're coming down now towards the last 15 minutes in on the goalkeeper real chance now shredding it through brilliant goal so we've got to admire the way he placed the ball into the bottom corner of the net but the goalkeeper was in a decent position but he was helpless to stop that one going in different angle on it here prospect of even more goals 4-2 is the score Dybala, Nicolas Otamendi, Herrera I spotted the pass and cut it out Neymar he has been pressed there to running the ball out of play well they've got to get goals haven't they and the only way to do it the manager thinks is to get another attacker on it'll make the game more open but he's got to take that risk yeah he's got to and this lad will need the service they need to get the ball wide get some good balls into the box still seven minutes left on the clock here's Icardi really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now in with a chance not really tested the goalkeeper but sometimes it can look a bit too easy he made sure he made the save confidently yeah he did and he doesn't make too many mistakes this lad they spread it out wide here chance to get some width into this attack well they're having to defend aren't they so he's come deep and he's got hold of the ball and they can build off him It's a very good interception. The ball has gone up to indicate three added minutes. Another turnover in play here with that interception. Lionel Messi. He's cut that out well, well read. Well, I like the look of this attack. There it is. Whistle's gone. Brazil have got the win. Nothing like that feeling of victory. It's less so, of course, in a friendly game, but it's still better than walking off beaten. Well, winning is a nice habit to acquire and this team have taken a step towards doing that. Alan, what did you make of the way Neymar influenced this game today? Oh, lots of energy, lots of quality and a good goal along with plenty of chances."}]}

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Welcome to you all to the Emirates Stadium as commentators and it's Martin Tyler here along with Alan Smith today. You always want to be put on the game that sees Arsenal play Manchester United and we're here. Yeah, we certainly are and it's one of those matches where it could define both teams' seasons with the right result. So it's a huge match this. Well, he's big, he's brawny and I can tell he's a very intelligent young man as well Romelu Lukaku, who is forging his career now, a strong strapping Belgian striker. What about this player? Four in his last three games. Watch out today. This is the Arsenal line-up. One thing to look out for from this team today is the way they try and win the ball back within seconds of losing it. Yeah, and they don't do it individually. They get backed up by a team-mate. They hunt in packs and you've got to do that. You've got to do it with discipline. This is then the Manchester United line-up. David De Gea starts in goal. Ashley Young starts with Luke Shaw as the full-backs. Paul Pogba plays with Nemanja Matic in central midfield. In attack, Romelu Lukaku starts. He's been in tremendous form recently. Real style in the Emirates Stadium, very much in keeping with the modern era, the luxury that the modern-day Premier League football fan expects when he comes to a ground. Yeah, and there's not a bad seat in the house, is there? Those seats are actually a lot bigger than the old ones at Hyde, the uncomfortable ones. You cannot complain about the viewing experience here. Well, that's not so much an interception as a poor pass. Nemanja Matic, now Lingard. Lukaku attacking well here. Rashford, cutting in now. Rashford! Oh, charged down. Well, a corner to come because of that deflection. Put the corner in the middle. Oh, that's good defending. Young, chance to put it in the box from here, and they get it away. It's Jesse Lingard. And here's Paul Pogba. Shots on him. He's blocked the shot well. Couldn't keep it in play, it's gone out for a throw. Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Now Mkhitaryan for Manchester United. A real match-up today, in for a team of their skill. Yeah, and an attacking team they're coming up against, so given how United play, I'm expecting big things here. Mkhitaryan, defended well. Arsenal have a corner. Corner played in. Played away, well away from goal. Lacazette. Excellent interception. Shots on! That was close, and well hit too. Yeah, he really did get the laces behind it. Nemanja Matic. Romelu Lukaku. It's Lingard. He could cross it now, but that's the keeper's ball from the moment the cross left his foot. Lukaku. It's Jesse Lingard. Lukaku. In powerfully there. Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Here's Andres Pereira. Lingard! Well, here it is. The first goal of a game that they have absolutely dominated. Very good play. Defence opened up again, but the difference is this time that they put the ball past the goalkeeper. Good finish, and they're looking a very classy side at the moment. Well, it was only a semblance of an opportunity really, but he's turned it into a great goal with a first-time strike. I don't think he had a chance, you know, to take another touch. He would have been crowded out, so what a decision. In front here are Manchester United. Mesut Ozil. Aubameyang. Lacazette. Now Mkhitaryan. Doing well to keep the ball. Here's Ozil. The shot's on! Simple save for David de Gea. Ashley Young. Now Lingard. There's the interception. There's some potential in this move. Lacazette. And it is a goal kick. It's a quick break. Lacazette! It's come off the goalkeeper, still in play. That's his game, isn't it? Intercepting. Well, this team's been playing some good stuff, and now the shot! Not far away at all. Well, if they keep creating chances, I'm sure they'll take one. That was a decent effort, you know. Now Lingard. Everything about Manchester United still seems to revolve around post Sir Alex Ferguson, who achieved so much. And we always felt, Alan, didn't we, that it would be very difficult in the years after he stood down as manager. Yeah, I mean, he's left a huge void. I think he will go down as the greatest club manager that's ever been. I regard him as that anyway, so anybody coming into that job is going to find it hard living in his shadow. Could be dangerous. Clever feet there to go inside his man. Rashford with the ball now. His man, shots on him. That's a corner for Manchester United. Corner's taken. Rashford! It's a miss at a significant time. Will that come back to haunt him? They could have been pulling ahead. Yeah, you see it so often that they are still in charge of this match. That's cut out. Lukaku. Cleverly done. Well, he's gone in a bit on the wild side. That's for Arsenal, a yellow. Oh dear, oh dear. He's committed himself and may be looking not to get a red. Paul Pogba, he's a man for the big occasion. Pogba! Well, the ball jumped there. They all got off the ground and they blocked the free kick. Safety first from the defender. Can't blame him for that. Here's Shaw. Now Paul Pogba. He's going to try his luck. Powerful drive. Close enough to suggest have another go, son. Yeah, strong shot. I think the keeper saw it coming all the way, though. It's a very good interception. Mkhitaryan aiming at Aubameyang. Good defensive clearance there. Now the possibility for a cross. Danger was looming large. They've got themselves back on the ball. Ozil. Now with Lacazette. Building steadily here, keeping possession. Licksteiner. Gnaticiaka. The shot's off! Very nearly a goal. It's hit the bar and it's back in play. Shaw. Could easily have been even Stephens, but if they keep on playing now, they are probing with the pass. Lingard. That's a brilliant piece of intercepting there at a crucial time in a crucial position. Three minutes of added time. Manchester United with the second half now underway and they are leading. Pogba. It's Pereira. Just read the intentions of the opposition there to make the interception. And the ball, knocked away Locke. Lindelof. It's Jesse Lingard. It's Pereira. Pogba. He's got his shot off now. I think that's a good performance, isn't it, Alan, from him in the first half? Yeah, it was a good first 45 minutes. Now Mkhitaryan. That was it. Kamani Chaka. Not a good challenge by the... Lacazette! Oh, the bar's still shaking. Going for goal! Goal for Arsenal, the equaliser. Yeah, you could argue that's against the good of play. Well, if you keep going in to that sort of area, the ball will drop for you and it dropped perfectly for him. I think that's a lesson to anybody enduring a goal drought. Keep getting in to the positions in the 18 yard, in the 6 yard box and you will score. You can't blame him. The manager is delighted with the character his team has shown to get back in to this game. It is level. Both sides have scored here now. Shaw. Nemanja Matic. Here's Andreas Pereira. It's Jesse Lingard. Romelu Lukaku. Well, here comes the support. And here's Paul Popper. Aubameyang. Maybe the counter attack is on here. It's one on one with the goalkeeper. Well, his laces behind that one. Took his eye off the ball, but not a bad effort. And Arsenal are going to bring on some fresh legs. It's Pereira. It's Lingard. Given away untidily by Jesse Lingard. Throw in to come. Here's Andreas Pereira. Lingard. Now Popper. He's got it away. Matic. Young. Pogba. Rashford with the ball now. And here's the shot. Shot blocked here. Tsiaka. Aubameyang. Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Lichtsteiner. Lacazette. Goalkeeper. It's his ball. He can really get at the opposition here. Here's Shaw. Rashford. He's given the free kick. It's in a really threatening position too. I think the manager has decided he wants to let the player have a great individual reception, which he wouldn't get at the final whistle. He's getting an ovation now as the substitution is made. Yeah, and well deserved too. It's too high. Yeah, maybe just leaning back and that was the downfall in that. Aaron Ramsey. Mesut Ozil. Aubameyang. It's looking good this match. It's looking good this move. A lot of defenders between them and the goal but they still got the ball. Good defensive clearance there. And it goes out from the header for a throw. Lichtsteiner. Now Mkhitaryan with Mesut Ozil. Able to cut that out with some sharp movement. Lukaku. Lichtsteiner. Now a chance to get a bit of width into this attack. Lichtsteiner. Mkhitaryan. Now it goes to Ozil. Shot's on him. No scraps for the attackers to feed on from the goalkeeper that time. Hung on to the ball well. Time ticking on. Just over 15 minutes to go. Quick witted and quick in his movement too to intercept there. Mesut Ozil. Trying to get the ball. Ashley Young. Good vision. The break is definitely on. Ramsey. Mesut Ozil. Now Mkhitaryan. Well defended. Not just getting across. He thought quickly as well. Counting down in the last 10 minutes here. 9 to go. Here's Shaw. Opportunity in a wider area. It's going to be a substitution for Arsenal. Well we're playing mind games here as well as the actual game of football. Lovely ball. That was it. He can cross it now. Arsenal have a corner now. In the closing moments of the game. Arsenal with the substitution. In goes the corner. Cleared away by the defender. It won't be. Ramsey. Alex Iwobi. Now he's looking for support. Got the opposition backpedalling a little bit. And that's into the gloves of the goalkeeper. Not the hardest thing he'll have to do today by any means. Togba. Togba. Togba. Togba. Togba. Rashford. If Manchester United are going to win this game they've got to get a goal now. Can put them in front here. It was another corner for the opposition to defend against Manchester United. They'll be looking to decide the game from it. The decider should be. Look at those fans. Amazing. Well you said it Martin. There aren't too many better sets than these. Romelu Lukaku. Rashford. Looked very good indeed. That's the referee's final whistle. And the scores are level."}]}

Good penalty. Completely wrong foot of the keeper. So the ball is placed on the spot. Dybala is next up. Coolidon, one each. He just did what he was asked. So, the second man in line. I thought he did really well to hold his nerve then and score that penalty. Mandzukic, his second man up. And the keeper's come up, trumps. The keeper's done brilliantly to keep his eye on the ball and make such a great save. Barcelona can go two ahead. Two to the good. Juventus can't afford to miss another one. Great stop.

The Juventus line-up then. Bojec Szczesny starts in goal. Giorgio Chiellini plays with Leonardo Bonucci as the full-backs. Milan Pjanic starts with Sami Khedira in the middle. And the great man is up front today, Cristiano Ronaldo. This is the Real Madrid line-up. Keylor Navas in goal. Rafael Varane starts with Sergio Ramos as the centre-backs. Luka Modric starts with Toni Kroos in the centre of the park. Karim Benzema is the lone striker today. Khedira. Dybala. The shot's on! And that shot, a great chance to go in front of the post. Well, they managed to dig themselves out of a pretty deep hole then. It was a great chance, I thought, but they're safe again. Bale with the ball at his feet in this wide area. Looking to the near post, where Benzema's arriving. Well, that's the keeper's ball from the moment the cross left his foot. Intercepted well. Kamahat. Shot's on him. The defenders managed to get in the way there. Gone short with the corner. And here's the shot. It's in! It's a great start for them. A wonderful goal. With the lead now. It's unlike him, really, to play the ball straight to the opposition. Well, he has cleared the danger. They could pose some danger now. Cuadrado! That is a fantastic goal. It's offside. That's what the assistant has said. Cuadrado. On to Ronaldo. Still such a danger with the ball at his feet. Cristiano Ronaldo. To bring them level. Very sharp. A short corner. Que tira! Sergio Ramos. Made a quick interception. Que tira! Gone for the ball. Tony Kroos. Modric. Here's Casemiro. Guiding the pass through. Well, the play has broken down now. Here's Alexandro. It's Isco. Modric. Bit of space to go forward into with the ball. He's got his shot off now. Good stop by the goalkeeper. Good work, really, to read the intention of the pass. That's a tremendous piece of play. Just read the intentions of the opposition there to make the interception. Well, suddenly they could be on the counter-attack. Dybala. To level it up now. Pressure has played off for Juventus. Level. Both sides have scored here now. Modric. Benzema. Sami Khedira. And Ronaldo. Dybala. Cleverly done. Douglas Costa. Maybe he'll cross it here. Goalkeeper can only parry it out. Well, that's good defending. Juventus will get the throw. Janic. The shot's on. That's a good block. It's going to be another throw now. Tony Kroos. Kroos. And the goalkeeper smacked that away. Dybala. Very important piece of defending with the interception there. Bale. Douglas Costa. Sami Khedira. Joao Cancelo. Dybala. Now Cuadrado. And that is now a goal kick. Tony Kroos. Marcelo. Neatly intercepted. Dybala. And he takes it on! Gareth Bale. Space ahead with Real on the ball. Cleared away, well away from goal. And Ronaldo. Dybala. Steered through by Dybala. Cristiano Ronaldo! Oh, that's a great goal! They're losing at the moment. Three minutes to go. Three minutes, that's what's going to be played for added time. Sergio Ramos. Modric. Good reading of the play, anticipating the pass. It's Isco. Marcelo. Saw the pass coming and got there first. Well, this is half-time, that's the whistle. So the referee's happy. The players are in position, the second half gets underway. Modric. Oh, we've got a free kick here. Referee points for it. Benzema. Carvajal. Marcelo. Isco. That's his game, isn't it? Intercepting. Bale. Time to get the ball in. Isco. Danger was looming large. He's gone in with the header. On the move and able to cut out the pass. Casemiro. Isco. And they get it away. Cedera. Cuadrado. Now this looks promising. Short passes, but they're keeping the ball. Challenges for the ball. Cuadrado. He's had a go. The defenders managed to get in the way there. Chance to go at the opposition with pace. Johnny Correa. They've got the ball back. The interceptor got it for them. Carvajal. Modric. A bit predictable with the passing and the opposition able to deal with that. Miralem Pjanic. We've reached the hour mark. Half an hour to go. Cristiano Ronaldo. Dybala. Douglas Costa. Ronaldo. Isco. Isco. Isco. Isco. Isco. Cuadrado. Douglas Costa. Just a mistake, really. He's not even asked too much of the opponent. It's just a mishit pass. They're going to try and do it with a substitute. Instant judgement and movement by the goalkeeper. Well, his starting position was very good and he showed a nice bit of pace to get out there. It's one back. Making good ground here. Juan Cuadrado. He's cleaned up here, hasn't he, with that clearance. Neatly intercepted. They've lost the ball and a counter-attack could be there. Coach is very disappointed because he can see the potential, as we could see, from the commentary position. Possession loss now. Bale. Karim Benzema. Now, Dani Ceballos. Here's Isco. Well read by the defender. Trying to slip it through. Douglas Costa, brilliant goal. 3-1 it is now for Scola. Ceballos, Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale. Well he's got support here, good challenge. Matuidi, we have a substitution coming up and it's coming up for Real Madrid. We've given it straight to the opposition. Marsella, wasteful pass, unforced error really. Dybala, it's a very good interception. Modric. The throw in for Real Madrid. Real Madrid have a substitute getting ready. Lucas Vazquez, Modric. Carvajal, trying to pick out someone in the centre. And scores! Well for all of you who love seeing headed goals, I do for sure, I know Alan does. A real chance. Plenty of goals here today, 3-2. You can see what he was trying to do, just stretch the opposition by getting the ball out wide but it's gone out for a throw. Modric. Modric. Here's Casemiro. Much happier times for Juventus these days. Fantastic Serie A triumph in the 11-12 season. The shot's on! Chan. It's 82 minutes played now. Well we've had some chances Alan but it's a while since we've had a goal. They've still got the lead. Yeah and they're knocking the ball about. Probing pass. Into the middle, sent there by Cuadrado. Defended well. Now Cuadrado. In behind the defenders. Well that was... Douglas Costa. Good forward play from them. Shot's on here. Powerful drive. Good here for his team. Top class. Real Madrid are trailing by one still. Looking to win it back. Now Casemiro. Modric. Karim Benzema. Marco Asensio. Modric. Opening them up with a through pass. Isco! Best keeper you can. He's earned all the points here. Here comes the corner. Cleared away by the defender. That's super feet there from the player. Those feet move so quickly. Marco As... Isco. Marco Asensio. Could whip it in from here. Keeper goes with... The victory today goes to Juventus. Well the game was organised so that the players could get some action. Get some sharpness back together. And they look pretty sharp. They've won. Yeah I think so. Managed to hit the net a couple of times. And the strikers will be happy more than most. Let's get a view on Cristiano Ronaldo's match here."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a British football commentator. Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there, everybody. We've got quite an intense rivalry for you in our main game today. It's Chelsea against Manchester United. I'm Martin Tyler, Alan Smith sitting alongside me to score the team for football skills and maybe for aggression as well because it's been built up this game, hasn't it? Yeah, it has. I mean, it's got a special ring to it going down the years, not just in this era. We've had some marvellous contests. Looking at the two teams, I think we might be in for a treat today as well. Hayden Hazard, such a feature of this game. Got to keep an eye out for him. Top score in the league with seven so far. Here's the Chelsea line-up. Azpilicueta starts alongside David Luiz in the heart of the defence. Hayden Hazard starts, a midfielder in good form. Morata is the sole striker today. This is then the Manchester United line-up. David De Gea starts in goal. Antonio Valencia starts with Luke Shaw as the full-backs. Paul Pogba plays with Nemanja Matic in central midfield. Romelu Lukaku is the sole striker today. Kick-off from Chelsea, we're underway. Well, he's got support here. Willian. Here's Morata. The limit goes. Good defensive clearance there. Morata. Willian. And that will end the threat, at least for the moment. Could get his cross in now. Alvaro Morata to Kovacic. Here's the shot. Hazard. Brilliant play and the goal from Hazard. Oh, that's classic Hayden Hazard. He's so strong in possession and such a cool head in front of goal. So a real captain's contribution here with a fine goal. Was a good goal and it came in a crucial time, I think, for his side. Captain's input there. Chelsea are ahead now. He's falling. Pogba. Fred. That's his game, isn't it? Intercepting. Willian. Morata. They've broken through again and scored again. Well, it's a super period of the game for this team. To get one goal was excellent, but now they've doubled their money. Well, let's take another look at the goal. Just widen the margin here to 2-0. There was a Manchester United-Chelsea game at Stamford Bridge towards the end of the 14-15 season. Chelsea did win the game. Manchester United had all the ball. It was a most unusual smash and grab from Jose Mourinho's men. Yes, he parked the bus at home almost there, didn't he? To get the job done as they edged towards the title. Trying to find an opening. Not panicking. Got the tackle in and he could clear it here. Mateo Kovacic. And that's going to be a goal kick. Played down the wing. Keeping the wide attack going. Looking for teammates in the middle. He had to clear it even at the expense of a corner. Here it is again. Another look at Morata's goal. Corner played in. It was a promising situation. They could have made more of that. Chelsea give it away. They saw the pass coming and got there first. Eden Hazard out in front of goal. You could tell the keeper was pleased with that and why wouldn't he be? Out the top draw, that's safe. Lukaku. Good reading of the play by the defender. Nemanja Matic. There's width here for Manchester United. Now the cross has gone behind. It's a poor effort. Kovacic. Marcos Alonso. Really trying to use the full width of the pitch here to make some progress. Eden Hazard gives it away. It's Jesse Lingard. Nemanja Matic. Trying to catch the other team out with a quick break here. Pogba. Incisive pass. Brilliant goal. Well, they were caught out here by this quick counter-attack against the run of play. Yeah, I mean they had to stick together there and come under a lot of pressure but with the pace in the team that was always likely. Off we go again. 2-1. Morata. Now Lingard. Marcos Alonso. Matteo Kovacic. Here's a chance to attack. Now Eden Hazard on the cross. It's not a cross that's caused the defence any problems and certainly not the goalkeeper. Slipping it through. It's Lingard. Gets his cross in. And they get it away. Throw in here. Alexis Sanchez. It goes out wide again. Could have been thrown in after the tackle. Sanchez. Well then it goes. Very straightforward piece of goalkeeping as he catches the cross. And the pass not completed really. Valencia. Rushing it here. Moving from one side to the other. Opportunity to cross it now. He worked so hard on his heading. He needs to do a bit more work I think. Yeah the keepers waving that one bye-bye. That's Filip Guetta. Conte. Matteo Kovacic. Hazard. Morata. Excellent vision. They can't stop him. Well, they managed to get out of harm's way then, because it looked as though there was going to be some real damage done to them. Sanchez. Hogbert, trying to put his team-mate in. Saw the pass coming, and got there first. Well, there's going to be three minutes added on. There will be a minimum of three minutes. Over towards Morata. Here's Shaw. On to the attack now. Well, this is half-time. That's the whistle. And here come Manchester United right at the start of the second half. Hogbert. That's an easy cut-out for the opposition. Saw the pass coming. Here's Willian. Pote. Cut-off! The defenders managed to get in the way there. Pogba. Pogba. Romelu Lukaku. Now Paul Pogba. Walked off the pass there. Good performance so far by Eden Hazard. I would be happy without the free kick conceded by Antonio Valencia. Clearly a booking. Out comes the yellow card. Well, he reached straight for his pocket. He didn't really think about it. But I think that's the good call. Two of them involved here. Jorginho. Alvaro Morata. Good position for the cross. Alvaro Morata. It's one back. That's good movement forward here. The shot's on! That shot's blocked very quickly. Oh, it's a corner. And that deflection. Swung in from the corner. Kovacic! Good stop by the goalkeeper. Lindelof. Sanchez. Alexis Sanchez. Steered through. And a Herrera pass. Just nicked it away from the attacker, the goalkeeper. Pogba. Pogba. And a Herrera. It's Jesse Lingard. Well, here comes the support. In with the chance. How did he save that? He's one of the best in the business for those kind of situations. Absolutely brilliant. In goes the corner. Well, the goalkeeper takes charge here from the corner. Kroen coming up. Substitute coming on to try and repair the damage now. Mateo Kovacic. Anticipated the direction of the pass and was able to intervene. Delivered towards Morata. Defended well. Antonio Valencia. Put through by Martial. Lukaku. Pogba! How did Manchester United miss that one? They're still trailing. Well, he'll get some stick off the fans if they get nothing from this match. That's Filipe Cueta. Mateo Kovacic. Eden Hazard. Hazard. Passed his man. Pulls it back now. Very straightforward save for the goalkeeper. Here's Shaw. Shaw. Alexis Sanchez. He spotted a teammate and he's got the technique as well as the vision to switch the play. Delivery to the far post. It's a brilliant volley. It deserved better. Just clipping the frame of the goal. The crowd enjoyed that one on the feet. I think he thought he'd scored with it. N'Golo Kante. Kante. Mateo Kovacic. Gone out over the touchline. That'll be a throw to the opposition. Chris Smalling. Dindelo. Romelu Lukaku. Shaw. Not rushing it here. Moving from one side to the other. Valencia. Anthony Martial. Anthony Martial. It's a drive of some power but off target. Yeah, unlucky. Didn't quite get set for that one. That's Filiqueta. Marcos Alonso. A test for the durability of Chelsea here. To hold off Manchester United in these closing minutes. Well they've got so much... It's not a cross that's caused the defence any problems. And certainly not the goalkeeper. Well they have played in a controlled way Chelsea. Winning at half time. They still have the lead. Manchester United need to find some fighting spirit here. They're a goal down. We've got ten minutes left on the clock. Trying a bit too hard trying to force the pass and it went straight to an opponent. They've worked so hard the team to be in front here. And that's been recognised by the supporters. Yeah I think they've recognised that it has been a really good performance. But still a bit of work to do. Kovacic. Now with Nazar. Kovacic. Could get his cross in now. Conte. The shot's on. That's a good block. Sanchez. Fellaini. Alexis Sanchez. Guided through. Lukaku. Mateo Kovacic. Marcos Alonso. Nazar. Morata. And another Conte. Kovacic. Now with Willian. They are a class act. As a team. This group of players. He's given offside. Yeah he's playing on the shoulder but just needs to hold. He's gonna touch. Just one minute left on the clock. Nazar. There's the final whistle. It's a win for Chelsea. Hard fought. This win. Two very evenly matched teams. Yeah sometimes it feels even better than if you were to win 3-4-0. Eden Nazar in his usual impish form here today. It's one thing picking this lad out to try and stop him. It's another thing actually accomplishing that feat. He's in really good form. Another goal. And another win for his team."}]}

They don't come any bigger than this in world football. It's El Clasico. It's Barcelona versus Real Madrid. A mouth-watering early-season clash today, first against Sport in the league, head-to-head. Make yourself comfortable, this could be a cracker. Of course, the game being played under lights this evening. So without further ado, we're heading for the Nou Camp with your commentary team of Martin Tyler and Alan Smith. Hello, everybody. I'm Martin Tyler. This is the Nou Camp. Welcome to you all. Well, it is this mouth-watering fixture. Barcelona against Real Madrid. Alan, you don't need to say much more on that, really. No. The names say it all, Martin. Two of Europe's heavyweights coming face-to-face. Can't wait for this one. First versus fourth, and this fourth-placed team is looking to knock the leaders off their perch with a good performance, and I think they've got the plans to do that here. What excitement at Barcelona with Neymar coming in, Alan. Of course, he's got to get in the team first, I suppose. Well, he has. He's an emerging talent, one of the most exciting talents in the world, and what I've seen of him in Brazil colours, he's got the ability and the confidence to do himself justice at the Nou Camp. It's always remarkable when you come to the Nou Camp and you see where the players come out past the chapel down there. If there are any late prayers needed, then I'm sure there's a perfect setting for it. They cater for everything. Yeah, and behind the scenes, you could argue it's seen better days. It maybe needs a facelift, but there's just something special about it. Malente, Lara Zabal, ready to get the game underway. Javier Mascherano. And the attacking now coming from Barcelona. And the ball now with Pepe. Well, the referee has blown for the free kick. I don't think he's going to produce the yellow card. Pepe. Well, he would have come here expecting this type of reaction today. Iniesta, Gareth Bale. Benzema. Good challenge. Pepe. Now Messi. Trying to get behind the defenders to get in a good cross. Good strong challenge. Neymar. They've got the ball back through a very good interception. Modric, he'll want to get the ball early. He's got it now. Iliara Mendy. Well, it was an ambitious effort and it nearly produced a great reward. He has scored from those kind of distances. Not this time. Here's Mascherano. Daniel Alves. Lionel Messi. Sergio Busquets. Neymar. Towards Xavi. Well, this attack has got a bit of menace to it. Got the tackle in. He's an old school player, that defender. He'll not worry about the niceties. Just clear his lines. He's done that. They've got a player to take the throw in this attacking area. Sergio Busquets. And that's got to be. And such quality in the build up and a brilliant finish. A wonderful goal. The passing really has clicked into play here. And the opposition had no answer. The movement and the way that the ball was played to the guy who scored the goal was of a very high order. You can only do that when you're playing with full confidence at the top of your game. And this lot out here are. Towards Bale. Modric. That's a vital stop. Lionel Messi. Neymar. Well, he might go for goal here. And the defenders just managed to deal with that. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. Benzema. Lionel Messi. Pedro. Here's the cross. Neymar. It's goal. With a brilliant header. The goal there was superbly taken. Coming in from the right. That was so invited. Wonderful delivery. Great ball. Great goal. Well, it was just perfect from the delivery to the finish. Top marks. Now it's 2-0. Really strong play in the tackle. And now Messi. And now can he score? Oh! It's hit very well and the goalkeeper was strong. Now Messi. What a chance here. Oh! And he's put it in for the goal. Well, with that goal, Alan, it should wrap it up for Barcelona. Well, I would have thought so. Surely no way back now. Barcelona very quickly into their stride today. They've just got to get back on their feet. Surely no way back now. Barcelona very quickly into their stride today. They're doing brilliant. Benzema. Gareth Bale. It's a cross from Gareth Bale. And the defender has coped well with that cross. And that's the referee signalling for half-time. Blowing his whistle. And it's 3-0 here at half-time. The manager of the winning team will just have to get his players motivated. Could be more even in the second half. The coaches have a chance to talk to the players. And certainly the team that's conceded the goal will be hoping that they've tightened things up a bit. Good challenge here. Pedro. Benzema. Trying to find Bale. That's easy for the defender. Too easy really. They'll be disappointed with the poverty really of the attacking play at the moment. And the tackle is made. And now they can capitalise on this. Neymar. What we've found here, two very well-matched teams. One has played right to potential and the other quite clearly hasn't. Yeah, I mean you can experience an off day which the losing team certainly is. But the side in the lead, well they've taken the chance. It's brilliant. Keep the ball at the moment. Iliara Mendy. Modric. Iliara Mendy. Mendy. It was a good idea to try and use the width on the pitch but it's gone out for a throw. Real Madrid have a substitute getting ready. Sergio Busquets. It's Messi. And the opponents come in strongly. Surely he's going to score here. And he takes the shot. Oh, not this time from Leo Messi. Well he gets into so many of these positions. He has to miss a few. Sergio Busquets. It's Messi. He has been playing absolutely on top of his game today. Yeah, he has. I mean ping the ball into him at any height and you know he's going to... He's gone for goal. Looking to take the corner quickly. And in comes the header. Up he went. The header, he just couldn't keep it down. He did most things right there. Found himself in some space and got up early. Pedro. Sergio Busquets. Chance for him. Here's the shot. And for Victor Valdez. That's a real victory for a goalkeeper in a one-on-one situation. He did it splendidly. Looking for Isco. I think it's really hard. Probably the hardest part of officiating to get these offside calls right. They do it much more often than not, don't they? Well, you get a fraction of a second. Extremely difficult. job i wouldn't want to do it back to cristiano ronaldo cristiano ronaldo there's no let up is there in the hostility towards him across the chevy alonso good interception by the defender leno messi pedro the countdown is on we're into nine minutes now promising play it's all the chance to grab the ball at the feet of the attacking player well if the striker had got his foot to it and nicked it away i think it'd have been a penalty pedro in midfield they've got it back via an interception chance for him it's all the chance to grab the ball at the feet of the attacking player well if the striker had got his foot to it and nicked it away i think it'd have been a penalty leonel messi it's one back modric now he'll get it back again trying to reach benzema and it goes for gold and there it is for real madrid well they picked the ball out of the net madrid to try and get it back for the restart but game's over it is scant consolation for them and the scoreline is three one well that's a moment for at least the fans to treasure they've seen their team score today but not too much in the grand scheme of things is it no i think they've realized that the the game is up that the result is decided but always nice to get a consolation and the referee has ended it here the manager"}]}

To be here at the Bernabeu It is an iconic football stadium And Real Madrid stand for so much That's good in the game It has got a certain magic attached to it And I have to say I've been to all the big stadiums in Europe In the world And this is my favourite It's magnificent Valente, Lara Zabal And it's in It's in Valente, Lara Zabal Ready to get the game underway And El Clasico Is underway Neatly intercepted It's Casemiro I like the look of this attack He could get across in here But it was an early foul And I think it's right for the referee to say Yeah, well, that's a free kick And, you know, you can't do that Trying to get closer to the ball The wall Referee's got the card out here for the offender Well, he shouldn't get booked for that Lack of discipline Hit it well Well, with him, you know he's going to go for goal But he's had better efforts, many of them I'd be surprised if he's allowed to take the next one after that Marcelo That's great defending there Stopping that attack Luis Suarez Is there any other fixture, Alan, that can Create such anticipation As Real Madrid, Barcelona Spain's Clasico Well, it's got a magical Kick it in Nowhere near No, he's miscued that

this, out comes the card And it's locked Free kick That's the best of Saito, really, isn't it Yeah, I think he shanked it, you know That was a horrible connection And now, Eliezer Ivan Rakitic Referee's had enough How'd it go, wide, to Messi Now Messi Iniesta Going for goal Well, it looked a bad miss, but I think the defender Just put him off Yeah, he's got to take a lot of credit for that Because he had to take the shot quickly The lad who was trying to score Rafael Varane Here's Casemiro And now, Iniesta Clever pass from Suarez In with a chance That's well, well, wide He'll take Alan on this effort From Iniesta Well, only he will know whether He was going for goal there In the end, he nearly scored Here's Casemiro Kroos Now Casemiro Tony Kroos Marcelo Wide out Wide out To Cristiano Ronaldo in that wide area Typical Ronaldo, he wants to take them on Pessima Now with Marcelo Pessima And here's the shot Great goalkeeping Referee's decision is a corner for Real Madrid Casemiro He's got support here Tony Kroos Casemiro Now, the shot's on And full extension, the goalkeeper makes the save Real Madrid get the corner G\u00fcrtner And here's the goal There's the goal And the goal Fouled He's had a really good go It's a decent effort that With plenty of stinging it Yeah not far away And he really did visit didn't he The manager's just trying to get his message across Down there, but weren't far off Taking the lead there And now Iniesta And now Iniesta Moving forward with some danger To the opposition now they're here Quite slow into their stride Real Madrid today Sergio Ramos And Ronaldo Lionel Messi Out wide to Lionel Messi Possibilities for Barcelona And now the shot And the goalkeeper plunged to make the save The goalkeeper plunged to make the save Coming up now A corner for Barcelona And it's taken It's under hit the corner And the man at the front post gets it away Shoots Struck the post Could have come out But then it went Well you're too young to remember At least have square goal posts And a lot more came out than went in In those days So for the attackers that's a Bonus of the change in the technology And in off the post Yeah and I think he deserved that though because Struck it well and Right into the corner It's Barcelona in front Modric Lionel Messi Ivan Rakitic On to the attack now Come away with the ball cleanly, great tackle Kroos Modric Johnny Kroos Rafael Varane Kroos Kroos Carvajal Kroos Modric Here's Cristiano Ronaldo Well this attack, there's got to be a menace to it Kroos It's the crossbar Benzema gives away the free kick here Kroos Now Casemiro They could pose some danger now Carvajal Modric Tackle here Luis Suarez Messi Suarez Oh it's off the bar Got to keep his nerve here One in front They would be a lot more comfortable if they were two in front And they really could have been Yeah Mike they look back on that with a bit of regret Because that was a great chance to extend the lead wasn't it Sergio Ramos Cristiano Ronaldo Ramos Well they're in a good position here Tried to tackle here And he's done that Gerard Deleuze Ivan Rakitic So it's 1-0 here as the half time whistle goes Well the player that we're featuring here has done well He's certainly been an influence on this first half Well he played really well didn't he Got himself a goal To put his team ahead He'll be pleased with that first 45 minutes Here in the Bernabeu We're underway in the second half Ronaldo Really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now And now he's looking for some support And here's the shot It's Ronaldo Wonderfully taken Well the equaliser has happened Took perhaps the opposition by surprise But we're level again It's what they've deserved Well let's take another look at the goal It is level Both sides have scored here now Ivan Rakitic Samuel Umtiti Sergio Busquets Modric Attacking well here Cristiano Ronaldo That's good support play from his teammates He's got his shot off now And the goalkeeper plunged to make the save Well here's a chance To get their noses in front from the corner And now the shot Swung in by Kroos Casemiro Shot's blocked very quickly It's a corner again Kroos to the corner Bounce back off the post And now Iniesta Ivan Rakitic Sergio Busquets To put them in front No way through says Navas With a save And might well he smile after that one Short the corner this time Suarez Jordi Alba Getting the ball back and thinking attack He might be through And he's got it Getting the ball back and thinking attack He might be through Got to be He was done very well here Well Corner count rises and rises It's a corner that's been wasted really Cut to the near post Lionel Messi Iniesta Luis Suarez Barcelona moving smartly here That is a free kick And they've got a chance to really make the most of that decision Iniesta Is off And a tourette Great goalkeeper Great save That move nipped in the bud By the raising hand That move nipped in the bud By the raising of the flag from the assistant To me like the timing of the pass And the run was spot on But Closer inspection No he was off Toni Kroos Modric In control It's Toni Kroos Always knows what he's going to do with the ball Before he receives it Modric Quite clearly a free kick Sergio Busquets Ivan Rakitic Getting forward well as a team now Turan Suarez And there's a score here And that has significance Because they're now into the lead Well he got to the Position of maximum opportunity It was an impossible opportunity to squander Yeah We often say it was an easy chance But you have got to be there And this lad has got The knack of doing that Real Madrid have gone behind in this game Gareth Bale Carvajal Now Casemiro Played forward A bit of menace in this attack Here comes the challenge Barcelona Benefiting from the Referee's interpretation of that Play on advantage Luis Suarez Carvajal Now Casemiro Tony Kroos Well this attack Could have been a menace to it Test taken Showing great reach Great reflexes The corner side Any keeper would be fed up Corner's taken And here's the shot Shot blocked here Corner count rising Real Madrid Swung in from the corner Good defensive clearance there Real Madrid A goal adrift Time against them They've got such quality still Well the crowd are doing the best To urge their players on here And time these running out Real Madrid A goal behind here still Coming on strong And looking to Play their way through now The equaliser here Oh they've got their equaliser That's the very least they deserve from this game. Time ticking away from them, they've found a way, they've dominated the play, they've had so much of the ball. The opposition have been defending gallantly but that resistance has finally been broken. Well this is the team in form isn't it, they are excellent these players today and they've got their reward here. You look at all of them, they all fancy getting on the score sheet, they're all drifting forward. Two teams brilliantly matched in this contest, it's level again. Incisive pass, moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here. Modric. Marcello. Karim Benzema, comes in with a tackle. Close, Benzema, Benzema up for grabs here. And here they are on the attack. Sergio Busquets. Toni Kroos, the number's gone up as far as added time is concerned it's four. Yeah and there's a sense of anticipation within this ground, they think they've got a decent enough chance now to do the necessary. Luis Suarez, there's some potential in this move, it's a quick break, a chance, so close, the post. If he's given the free kick he's well up with play this late in the game. Yeah signs that he'd lost his head actually and he was going to get sent off having already been booked. Kroos, with the scores level. Well we're off and running again after that period of rehydration, refreshment, and they've got extra time now in front of them. It's messy, able to cut that out with some sharp movement. Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets. Trying to stretch the opposition using the wider areas here. Gerard Delefeu treads it through, trying to pick out Messi and they've got it away from the danger. Busquets, Delefeu, Paulinho, corner, Barcelona. Corner played in, not able to take full advantage of a good position. Adetouran, he's on the move all the time and makes lots of these interceptions. Benzema and Ronaldo, Modric. Rafael Varane, Real Madrid looking good here. Jordi Alba. There's the interception. Good vision. Penalty given for Barcelona. Is that just a case of mistiming the tackle? Well I think so, the referee doesn't need to make a mountain out of the small hill but it is a foul. And scores from the spot. Probably the last man you want to face from a penalty is Lionel Messi and you can see why. The goal, wherever you look at it, it was very well taken. Real Madrid have gone behind in this game. The crowd may be expecting a bit more but it's two added minutes. Good position, they've worked this attack very well into a quite a dangerous position now. Promising build-up until that challenge and maybe the counter-attack is on here. First period of extra time is over, 15 minutes still to go and the possibility of penalties. Well we've got 15 minutes left as we start the second period of extra time. Rafael Varane. Now Casimiro. There's good progress with this attack. Here's Casimiro, here's Cristiano Ronaldo, completely intercepted. Luis Suarez. Sergi Roberto. Really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now. He's very confident with the ball at his feet. Close! They've pulled it back level with this goal. Well the equaliser has happened, took perhaps the opposition by surprise. But we're level again, it's what they've deserved and that's a goal well worth analysing again. Great news for the manager because I think he made a couple of changes there and now they're back on level terms. Well I wonder where we go from here now that we're level again in the game. Anything can happen. Sergio Busquets. Well if they want to avoid the penalty shootout they better score in the next five minutes. Made away, well away from goal. Here's Casimiro. Marcelo. Tackle goes in. Sergio Busquets. Nice return pass. Luis Suarez. Gets his cross in. Well here comes the support. The shot's on! Well nowhere near. No he's miscued that one, miscued it badly. And that's the referee's decision, two added minutes. We have to praise the defenders of course and that was a good piece of reading the play but could they have done better the attacking side? And this is the first penalty here. Pressure on. Oh brilliant stuff from him, wasn't going to be foxed there. Right into the bottom corner, not just what you want at this stage. And the penalty is Benzema. What a save! All you need to do is put it in the net in the shootout and he's done it. Penalty now, Luka Modric. And the goalkeeper has done well to stop that one, it's potentially the match winning penalty. The goal and the game is theirs. And he's put it away to get the winning penalty. Well it can look easy can't it? And he's made it look easy there. Well there's a goal that's perhaps not gone according to the script here. They've just picked their moment to get forward after a lot of defending. Yeah and they can thank the defenders for that but when they did get the ball they moved it forward really quickly. They were ruthless there. Well you as a top striker in your time you must have appreciated what's happened here with all these goals and how well they were taken. Yeah I think it's been the reward for two sides being positive from the off and as a result we've seen plenty. Yeah."}]}

Well, Cristiano Ronaldo, he is all about pace, about him stripping his defender. It's going to be fascinating to see. As for Lionel Messi, he is known for his interplay, got such quick feet, knows how to... P\u00e1rez is the lone striker today for Real Madrid and got the game started here. Toni Kroos. Well played. Trying to reach Benzema. And now the shot! The goalkeeper didn't have to move to make that save. Lionel Messi. A break maybe from Barcelona. Back interplay off the crossbar. Karim Benzema. Real Madrid looking to win this match today. It won't be easy for them. Barcelona's ball, Dani Alves. Well, he saw the guy he could switch the play to and came up with a pass as well. Excellent. He's cut out that pass. It wasn't an accident. He read the mind of the opponent. Lionel Messi. Neymar. Now he's looking for support. Rodr\u00edguez. Karim Benzema. Towards Bale. He'll throw in for Real Madrid. Modric. Trying to stretch the opposition using the wider areas here. Up for grabs here. Lionel Messi. Pepe. Modric. And here is the birthday boy. Calvajal. Tremendous understanding from these players. Rodr\u00edguez. Jordi Alba. Modric. Towards Rodr\u00edguez. Great work by the goalkeeper. The ball is his and he's made sure he's protected it. Not really happened so far for Barcelona. And it's gone out of play there. Jordi Alba. Iniesta. Well, he's got support here. It's a bad pass. He's given it straight to the opposition. Rodr\u00edguez. This could be an opening for Real Madrid. And a goal! They've opened the scoring now. A goal from Benzema. And that is a wonderful side foot. He knew exactly where the keeper was. In fact, he couldn't get there. So the first goal, it's 1-0. Gerard Piqu\u00e9. It's a steamy welcome for a player not very much liked in these parts. The break is definitely on. Bale! Splendid goal here. A goal for Bale. Talk about placing it. He knew exactly what he wanted to do with it. Just widen the margin here to 2-0. Jordi Alba. On towards Messi. A chance! He's just reached it. The goalkeeper. Corner. Barcelona. That's half-time. Here in the Bernabeu, we're underway in the second half. Jordi Alba. Gareth Bale. Iniesta. Opportunity now. And he scored for Real Madrid. A goal for Benzema. Well, he's just tethered that into the right-hand side. That is a wonderful take. Well, they've widened the margin now. 3-0 they lead. Gerard Piqu\u00e9. There's no let-up, is there, in the hostility towards him? Jordi Alba. Carvajal. On to Ronaldo. Substitute ready to come on for Barcelona. Luis Su\u00e1rez. Lionel Messi. Trying to find Su\u00e1rez. Well, they're losing by a lot, but they've actually now improved the situation. A goal from Su\u00e1rez, and the way he's followed it, the keeper really couldn't get across quickly enough. It's a fantastic strike. Just a reminder, 3-1 it is now, the scorer. Piqu\u00e9 down at that bench. Barcelona want to make a change now. Well, here comes the support. Rodriguez. That's an easy interception, because the pass wasn't really a very thoughtful one. But he's got his fist to it. That's a foul by Mathieu. Sergio Ramos. Rodriguez. Oh, lost possession here. And they've got their new man ready, Barcelona, to make the change. Jordi Alba. Neymar. Gareth Bale. And now it's a 3-1. Neymar. Gareth Bale. Carvajal. Piqu\u00e9. Towards Neymar. We have a substitution coming up, and it's coming up for Real Madrid. Jeremy Mathieu. Towards Neymar. And now it's a 3-1. We have a substitution coming up, and it's coming up for Real Madrid. Jeremy Mathieu. Towards Neymar. Trying to stretch the opposition, using the wider areas here. Sergio Busquets. So they can regroup now and a goal kick. When you're outplayed in midfield it's a really tough ask in a match of this calibre. He has been outplayed in midfield, he's off now and he'll probably be quite relieved. He's a player that likes to get his foot on the ball to dictate the tempo but never got close to doing that here. He's got in and blocked it. No scraps for the attackers to feed on from the goalkeeper that time. Hung on to the ball well. The goalkeeper with a textbook save and keeps the ball in his grasp. Well there goes the final whistle, the referee has blown and the final score 3-1. Ready now to go into competitive action again. You would feel having won this friendly. Yeah, they look just about ready to me. They look fit and they've settled into a system that they look comfortable with. Let's get just some final words from Alan Smith on Karim Benzema. An important player today, Alan. Well, so often we think of his creative abilities but a couple of goals here have won the match for his team. The break may be from Barcelona. Shot on! Back into play off the crossbar. Rodriguez. This could be an opening for Real Madrid. The shot's on! And a goal! And they've opened the scoring now. The break is definitely on. Bale! Splendid goal here. And shoots! He's just reached it, the goalkeeper. I'll be happy with that first 45 minutes. It was a good goal. Opportunity now. And he's scored for Real Madrid. Lionel Messi. Trying to find Suarez. Hit on the volley. Well, they're losing by a lot but they've actually now improved the situation. they deserve from this game. Time ticking away from them, they've found a way, they've dominated the play, they've had so much of the ball. The opposition have been defending gallantly but that resistance has finally been broken. Well this is the team in form isn't it, they are excellent these players today and they've got their reward here. You look at all of them, they all fancy getting on the score sheet, they're all drifting forward. Two teams brilliantly matched in this contest, it's level again. Incisive pass, moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here. Modric. Marcello. Karim Benzema, comes in with a tackle. Close, Benzema, Benzema up for grabs here. And here they are on the attack. Sergio Busquets. Toni Kroos, the number's gone up as far as added time is concerned it's four. Yeah and there's a sense of anticipation within this ground, they think they've got a decent enough chance now to do the necessary. Luis Suarez, there's some potential in this move, it's a quick break, a chance, so close, the post. If he's given the free kick he's well up with play this late in the game. Yeah signs that he'd lost his head actually and he was going to get sent off having already been booked. Kroos, with the scores level. Well we're off and running again after that period of rehydration, refreshment, and they've got extra time now in front of them. It's messy, able to cut that out with some sharp movement. Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets. Trying to stretch the opposition using the wider areas here. Gerard Delefeu treads it through, trying to pick out Messi and they've got it away from the danger. Busquets, Delefeu, Paulinho, corner, Barcelona. Corner played in, not able to take full advantage of a good position. Adetouran, he's on the move all the time and makes lots of these interceptions. Benzema and Ronaldo, Modric. Rafael Varane, Real Madrid looking good here. Jordi Alba. There's the interception. Good vision. Penalty given for Barcelona. Is that just a case of mistiming the tackle? Well I think so, the referee doesn't need to make a mountain out of the small hill but it is a foul. And scores from the spot. Probably the last man you want to face from a penalty is Lionel Messi and you can see why. The goal, wherever you look at it, it was very well taken. Real Madrid have gone behind in this game. The crowd may be expecting a bit more but it's two added minutes. Good position, they've worked this attack very well into a quite a dangerous position now. Promising build-up until that challenge and maybe the counter-attack is on here. First period of extra time is over, 15 minutes still to go and the possibility of penalties. Well we've got 15 minutes left as we start the second period of extra time. Rafael Varane. Now Casimiro. There's good progress with this attack. Here's Casimiro, here's Cristiano Ronaldo, completely intercepted. Luis Suarez. Sergi Roberto. Really getting at the opposition this far up the pitch now. He's very confident with the ball at his feet. Close! They've pulled it back level with this goal. Well the equaliser has happened, took perhaps the opposition by surprise. But we're level again, it's what they've deserved and that's a goal well worth analysing again. Great news for the manager because I think he made a couple of changes there and now they're back on level terms. Well I wonder where we go from here now that we're level again in the game. Anything can happen. Sergio Busquets. Well if they want to avoid the penalty shootout they better score in the next five minutes. Made away, well away from goal. Here's Casimiro. Marcelo. Tackle goes in. Sergio Busquets. Nice return pass. Luis Suarez. Gets his cross in. Well here comes the support. The shot's on! Well nowhere near. No he's miscued that one, miscued it badly. And that's the referee's decision, two added minutes. We have to praise the defenders of course and that was a good piece of reading the play but could they have done better the attacking side? And this is the first penalty here. Pressure on. Oh brilliant stuff from him, wasn't going to be foxed there. Right into the bottom corner, not just what you want at this stage. And the penalty is Benzema. What a save! All you need to do is put it in the net in the shootout and he's done it. Penalty now, Luka Modric. And the goalkeeper has done well to stop that one, it's potentially the match winning penalty. The goal and the game is theirs. And he's put it away to get the winning penalty. Well it can look easy can't it? And he's made it look easy there. Well there's a goal that's perhaps not gone according to the script here. They've just picked their moment to get forward after a lot of defending. Yeah and they can thank the defenders for that but when they did get the ball they moved it forward really quickly. They were ruthless there. Well you as a top striker in your time you must have appreciated what's happened here with all these goals and how well they were taken. Yeah I think it's been the reward for two sides being positive from the off and as a result we've seen plenty. Yeah."}]}

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, once again, I'm Martin Tyler and this is Old Trafford. Well, it's Liverpool against Manchester United, if you're of a certain age, you'll remember when Liverpool were top dogs in the 70s and 80s, and Alex Ferguson came down from Scotland to try and change that, and he did, and Manchester United, obviously, in the last decade of the last century, the first decade of this century, he got what he wanted, but that rivalry still really exists. Yeah, it does, and if you ask the players, and particularly the fans, they will say this derby is the one they look to at the start of every season. The featured player for us today is Juan Mata. Yeah, and quite right too, I think he's one of those that, when on top of his game, he really is difficult to stop, because he pops up in those areas, finds those pockets of space. As for Roberto Firmino, he's got priceless ability on the ball, he can manufacture it in tight spaces. This is then the Manchester United line-up. David De Gea starts in goal, Aston Schweinsteiger plays McMichael Carrick in the middle, and at the point of attack, just one lone striker. This is the Liverpool side. Simon Mignolet starts in goal, Martin Skrtel starts with Dejan Lovren as the centre-backs, Emre Can plays with Lucas in the middle, Christian Benteke is the sole striker today. For a long period, this was a place where Manchester United seemed to be totally unbeatable. Then they've had one or two changes of management, of course, which is always likely to happen when Alec Ferguson retired after so many years, and some of the visitors have been able to come away with points which they would never have expected to get in the past. Yeah, maybe the fear factor has diminished, and it's up to the manager that's in place at the time to try and build that back up again. For my part, I never scored here, so it wasn't a favourite ground of mine. Roberto Firmino. And it's the tackle that stops the attack here. Milner. Here's the cross. Good play, one-on-one. It's good movement. They're getting forward here, Manchester United. Good play, but they've lost the ball now, and the opposition can get at them. It'll be a throw. Shaw. Nothing wrong with that tackle. In fact, it was a terrific effort. It was a good season, 14-15 for Manchester United. They did the league double over Liverpool, although the game at Old Trafford... I mean, Liverpool actually played really well, but they were beaten 3-0. Yeah, and that was actually the start of... And shoots! A great work by the keeper. Corner for Manchester United. Fellaini! What a shot! And this is a goal. Superb goal here. The keeper's pulled off a really good save, but that's when he needs the help of his defenders. So the first goal, it's 1-0. Gomez. Lovren. James Milner. Fellaini. And he's reached it well. Emre Can. And it's a goal. And he's reached it well. Emre Can. Lovren. Gomez. And the throw with a bit of urgency about it to keep the attack going. Damian. Schweinsteiger. Fellaini. Good position. They've worked this attack very well into quite a dangerous position now. Mata. Fellaini. James Milner. Emre Can. Being moved around nicely here with this passing game. And that will clear the danger. Cross coming in now. And that will clear the danger. That will be a corner for Liverpool. Another chance to see Carrick's goal. And the goalkeeper coming off his line. He's got that through clever reading of the game. Intercepting and getting possession back for his team. Cross is blocked. And in goes the cross. And he claims the cross. Well, the flag's up. He's frustrated because he is caught offside. Maybe he made his run a bit too soon. And the cross comes in now. James Milner. James Milner. Referee had a good look at that. Decided it's just a throw after the tackle. Very confident to get the game moving again. Throw in for Liverpool. Nathaniel Clyne. Skirtle. That is a free kick. That was a free kick. An easy decision for the ref. Well, it is. He saw the ball and he thought he could win it. But just a fraction off. Well, only two more minutes to be added on. And he's met it with his head. He's off target. And that really was a big moment. The equaliser was beckoning. Well, it wasn't a simple chance. But it really deserved a bit better than that finish. So it's 1-0 here as the half-time whistle goes. Liverpool. Liverpool. Liverpool. Liverpool. Liverpool. Liverpool. Liverpool. Liverpool. Liverpool. Well, I like the look of this from the neutral point of view, Alan. We're gonna get an extra attacker on for the team. That's done the better attacking and leading in the game now. Well, they do say the best form of defence is attack and that's the principle he's taken here, the manager. Michael Carrick. Menteke. Schweinsteiger. Lucas. James Milner. Back to him again. Roberto Firmino. That's a free kick against Manchester United. Good skill, just to lift the ball there at the right moment. Well, the player that we're featuring here has done well. He's certainly been an influence on this first half. He played really well, didn't he, and he got himself a goal to put his team ahead. He'll be pleased with that first 45 minutes. Lovren. Manchester United with the ball again. And Herrera. Substitution for Liverpool. Referee says free kick. Well, they're still trailing and they need to do something now if they want to get back into this game. Maybe some fresh legs will do the trick. Nathaniel Clyne. Skirtle. That is a cheap piece of play to give the ball away like that. Schweinsteiger. Really on top of their game now. Wonderful understanding. The shot's on. It's come off. And Herrera. And a goal. The goal then for Manchester United. Oh, that's a lovely poacher's goal. Johnny on the spot to tap it home. Just widen the margin here to 2-0. Not a good challenge by the defender. Spaced across the ball now. That's a useful ball in. Liverpool have got a new man ready to come on. And that's a pass that's gone astray, out of play. James Milner. Nathaniel Clyne. Definitely a throw-in there. Michael Carrick. He's cut out the pass. Intercepting, if you like. And now can go on the attack, maybe. Freshening it up a little with the substitute now. And that's a goal. And that's a goal. And that's a goal. And that's a goal. And that's a goal. And that's a goal. Well, it will be dealt with easily by the defenders there. It wasn't a great cross, in truth. Now they can build from the back, the opposition. We are in the last chance saloon for Liverpool. Well, the manager on the sidelines has made his intentions clear. He's waving quite a few defenders forward. Just going to get that ball into the box, whichever way is possible. Mata. Menteke. Menteke. In for Skrto. And it's a shot that the goalkeeper can deal with quite comfortably. Throw-in for Liverpool. Lovren. Oh, dispossessed. They could be in trouble. He's going to try it. Great save by a diving goalkeeper. And the cross coming in. Well, the ball deserved perhaps a better response from his teammates in the middle. The defender got there first, though. Wasteful pass. Unforced error, really. Nathaniel Clyne. Skrto. That's a good challenge between the two of them there. And Herrera. What a goal! A goal for Memphis. And he's not hit it with power, has he? But he's certainly hit it with accuracy. A little surprising that it is as one-sided as this late in the game. But the team leading deserve the margin of what's going to be a very comfortable victory. We're down now to the final two minutes of the 90. Skrto. Well, just one minute of added time to come. Lucas. Possession in the midfield area. He wants to play on the shoulder of the last defender. He's just got to get it right. It's all about timing. And the referee has brought the hawk to it. That's full time. Brilliant. It's a good season. 14-15 for Manchester United. They did a great work by the keeper. they deserve from this game. Time ticking away from them, they've found a way, they've dominated the play, they've had so much of the ball. The opposition have been defending gallantly but that resistance has finally been broken. Well this is the team in form isn't it, they are excellent these players today and they've got their reward here.

Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there again, Martin Tyler here, Alan Smiths alongside me, and it's Barclays Premier League action for you. What was amazing when Manchester City won that league in 2014, Chelsea did the double over them. They actually did the double over the second place team, Liverpool, as well, so there was some regrets, I think, at the end of that season. Chelsea got the edge over Manchester City today, do you think? Well, it's a difficult one to call. Chelsea, as always, have defended really well this season, and I think they're going to make it hard for City here. Best defence in the league, Manchester City. Well, defending is an art, and sometimes a forgotten one in this day and age, but this lot haven't forgotten it, that's for sure. Several changes for Manchester City. Kyle Walker starts with Marcelo as the full-backs. Kevin De Bruyne plays alongside Fernandinho in the middle of the park. Sergio Aguero is the sole striker. Wholesale changes for Chelsea. Steve Ocotoa plays today, replacing Wilfredo Caballero, who's not looked that confident lately. Andreas Christensen plays with Gary Cahill in central defence. Danny Drinkwater comes in for Cesc Fabregas, who's injured. Eden Hazard starts together with Morata. Manchester City, well, they'll be working hard, I'm sure. Their last game was an away defeat against Swansea City. Well, it was 1-0, and they played pretty well, I think, for large parts of the game, and for that reason, I think, they'll probably win today. The match under the control of Mike Jones. Manchester City have started this first half. Now Fernandinho. Marcelo. Kevin De Bruyne. It's a decent cross. Well, the cross came in, but it went straight to the opposition, and now they might break Kevin De Bruyne. Silva. And here's the shot. That's a very worthy effort. Just outside the post. Cahill. That's Filipe Cueta. The away team come here having drawn their last two games, which shows a competitive streak, but maybe not quite the winning mentality that they need. No, but you wonder whether a draw here would be satisfactory, whether they take that now. Silva. Aguero. Kyle Walker. Trying to stretch the opposition using the wider areas here. He's spotted a teammate, and he's got the technique, as well as the vision, to switch the play. Again, possession squandered, really. Silva. Here's a chance to move forward from midfield after that interception. Marcos Alonso. He'll get a free kick for that. On EA Sports very soon for you, the Champions Cup fixture. Chelsea, they'll be hosting Roma. Yeah, high quality fixture, this one. There won't be much call to give it. A chance! Terrific stop. Morata. Shot's on here. Sterling. Sergio Aguero. Looking to get the ball forward here. Manchester City. He's tackled well. It's a good challenge, but it's led to a corner. He's got his shot off now. Aspilicueta who blocked the shot. Manchester City looking for victory today. It won't be straightforward, they understand that. Sterling. Looking for Aguero. Hazard. Eden Hazard. Possession back with Manchester City now. Kyle Walker. Kevin De Bruyne. Marcelo. Well, they look promising there in that wide area, but the defenders done well. Christensen. Manchester City have the ball again. Here's Walker. Fernandinho. A slight tackle, very successfully done. And here we've got a free kick given by the referee. Christensen. Morata. I love having the ball, this fella. Just lent it to his teammate for a moment. There's going to be a throw-in after that tackle. Kroos coming in now. That will help ease the pressure. Here's Sterling. And it's going to be his throw here. Silva. He's got his tackle in, and the ball's gone out now. Conte. There's your Aguero. Aguero! Comfortable that for the goalkeeper. Morata. Conte. Fernandinho. He can hit it here! He's hit it straight at the keeper. Not really what he wanted to do. Fernandinho. Manchester City are on the attack now. Sterling! Taking a chance with the shot there. Yeah, thought he might have done better there. Had a bit of time and space. Good position. They've got the ball in the middle of the pitch here. Marsella. Here's Sterling. And there is the halftime whistle. 0-0 at the break. Well, it's level pegging at halftime. And the home defence, which has been so solid, not quite so solid. Yeah, those defenders have done their job. They're just looking to the attackers now to nick a win. Chelsea to start this second half then. Kevin de Bruyne. Marsella. He's going to cross it. Aguero! A great work by the keeper. Real good contest between these two as they jostle for possession. And the cross coming in. Silva. And the tackle there is successfully done. Nicolas Otamendi. David Silva, such a clever attacking player. Another shot! Brought back as Filiqueta. They want to keep the opposition penned back. This throw can help do that. Kevin de Bruyne. Marsella. Fine cross. Well, the ball deserved perhaps a better response from his teammates in the middle. The defender got there first, though. Yeah, it's gone out of play and it will be a throw from that headed clearance. Sterling. Almost tackled out of play there in that challenge. And very confident to get the game moving again. Now Fernandinho. Kante. Cahill. Manchester City have the ball again. And it's out now for a goal kick. Kante. Kante. Really strong tackle and the ball's gone out for a throw. David Silva to be substituted. Morata. Eden Hazard. Able to make a good interception. Shots on! A player's a bit unhappy about this, but we can see it again, whether it should have been offside or not. It was called offside. Well, who'd be a linesman, but this linesman is one of the best and he gets it right here. Nicolas Otamendi. Time for the substitutes, I think, for Chelsea. Here's Walker. Fernandinho. Bing. He's got his shot off now. Back off the bar. Manchester City have the ball again. Marsella. Well, the ball's been deflected out, so it'll be a throw in. Substitution coming up for Chelsea. That's a good challenge between the two of them there. And that clearly is a goal kick. So we can see again that effort on goal from Ag\u00fcero. Yeah, the head up. It was a bit of a wild attempt, that. Hit with power. Should have done better. Kevin De Bruyne. Good one. Shot's on here. He's allowed three substitutes and two of them coming on together here. And it's a header. Terrific stop. Well, we've been privileged to watch two of the best goalkeepers and some of the saves they've made have been outstanding. The corner has led to that effort at goal, which wasn't far away. Wasn't far away and they did well to engineer a few yards of space there. Cahill. Cahill. Conte. Pedro. Turnover there that we didn't expect. Walker, Kevin De Bruyne, and they're passing so well out there, he could be in! De Bruyne! And he scores spectacularly! A late goal from De Bruyne up, and well that's evaded the keeper's grasp. A really good finish from him. Well it's a goal worth replaying over and over again, isn't it? Had to wait a while to get the first goal of the game. He sensed it was coming, it's finally arrived. When you think about football as a passing game, which it is, you think about players like him. Well they're back defending and they've cut the pass out there, and maybe that will ease the pressure. It's too close to call this, but they've still got a one goal advantage. Chelsea running out of chances now. Well those defenders are going to be asked to... This could be a chance! A chance! He's just reached it, the goalkeeper! Well they know their positions here, they know their jobs defending this corner. And here's the header, got his head to it well, but no power. Well to get there first, to find some space, but couldn't apply the finishing touch. They've worked so hard, the team, to be in front here, this could be it. Pedro! Oh goodness me, it's an equaliser, so late in the day. A late equaliser from Pedro. Well he's hit it hard and he's hit it first time, but perhaps the keeper could have got more on that. Well let's take another look at the goal. So away we go at one all. Well it could have been a shot of significance, it's turned out to be a shot of insignificance. Could have been a selfish decision that one, from the player, when he could have easily passed it. Good one. Well it could have been a shot of significance, it's turned out to be a shot of insignificance. Could have been a selfish decision that one, from the player, when he could have easily passed it. Well it could have been a selfish decision that one, from the player, when he could have easily passed it. The shot's on! Well narrow margins in the match and in this incident. Yeah not far off, that would have made a difference to the outcome if it had gone in. Well it could have been a shot of insignificance, it's turned out to be a shot of insignificance. Good one. Now Fernandinho. Kyle Walker. Looking for Marcelo. And the referee has ended it here. What about this as a draw, Alan? Lots of attempts from one team. Well there wasn't a lack of chances created, Martin Wozner, but on the day they couldn't take them and the strikers particularly would be disappointed. EVERY FLAMENGO MATCH IN THE STATE AND BRAZILIAN CHAMPIONSHIPS ONLY ON PREMIERE Oh brilliant stuff from him, wasn't going to be foxed there. Right into the bottom corner, not just what you want at this stage. And the penalty is Benzema. What a save! All you need to do is put it in the net in the shootout and he's done it. Penalty now, Luka Modric. And the goalkeeper has done well to stop that one, it's potentially the match winning penalty. The goal and the game is theirs. And he's put it away to get the winning penalty. Well it can look easy can't it? And he's made it look easy there. Well there's a goal that's perhaps not gone according to the script here. They've just picked their moment to get forward after a lot of defending. Yeah and they can thank the defenders for that but when they did get the ball they moved it forward really quickly.

It's always been that way. Other factors as well as football involved in the rivalry here, Barcelona and Real Madrid. Well, what an atmosphere inside the stadium and what a match we should have. Star-studded line-ups here in front of us. This is the Real Madrid line-up. Keylor Navas in goal. Sergio Ramos plays with Pepe in central defence.

Not plenty of appeals, but it is a corner by that tackle. Jordi Alba. Well, they're in a good position here. Trying to find an opening. Not panicking. Free kick against Real Madrid. That's going to be a yellow card for this player. He can't have any complaints. Here he is. He went in well. Really good attacking play. Ramos is the man. Cross coming in for Cristiano Ronaldo. Well, they're good at corners. Let's see what this one brings. I think any football fan would say when the rain comes down like it's coming down now it's going to add to the thrills. A few spills, possibly. Well, it normally does, doesn't it? Shots on here. They've blocked it then. And they've covered it out. Barcelona striving to get into their stride here. Really trying to use the full width of the pitch here to make some progress. Well, that looked promising. But he's been stopped. Modric. They've got the ball back, Barcelona. Iniesta. Ivan Rakitic. Played back. They've got a great understanding, this team. Just look at the passing. Gets his foot in there. And now, Iniesta. Barcelona get the advantage. Sergio Busquets. Barcelona on the attack. Terrific tackle. Gareth Bale. Bale. Carvajal. Toni Kroos. Kroos is in. Well, the ball deserved perhaps a better response from his teammates in the middle. The defender got there first, though. Good defending. Gareth Bale. Bale. Real Madrid looking good with this attack. Modric. It's a cross from Gareth Bale. Keeper comes and claims it. And no great risk. Here in the Bernabeu, we're underway in the second half. A break maybe from Barcelona. Defender to it first. It's a throw in for Barcelona. Tique. Lionel Messi. Iniesta. And they've got their new man ready, Barcelona, to make the change. Keeps it going well. A lot of defenders between them and the goal, but they've still got the ball. Cross coming in from Cristiano Ronaldo. Good clearance. Kroos. Well, this attack has got a bit of menace to it. That's offside. Cristiano Ronaldo just failed to look across the line. Sergi Roberto. Sergio Ramos wants to get that ball. Here comes the cross. Well, the ball deserved, perhaps. And now the shot! Well, you can't fault them for that lack of effort. It's still level. Sergio Busquets. Sergi Roberto. Turan. Now it goes into the wider areas where they've got a winger waiting. Well, the ball's been deflected out, so it'll be a throw in. Substitute ready to come on for Barcelona. Short passes, but they're keeping the ball. Jordi Alba. Toni Kroos. Marcelo. On to Ronaldo. Karim Benzema. Still 20 minutes to go. Trying to reach Benzema. And here come Real Madrid. Made the challenge well. Well, they passed their way up into a good position here, and then just lost the concentration. Lost the ball as well. They've got to work hard to try and get it back. Saw the pass coming and got there first. Well, this could be a really sharp counter-attack. Karim Benzema. Moving forward with some danger to the opposition now they're here. They've got the ball back, Barcelona. Seji Roberto. Lionel Messi. There's some potential in this move. And the cross is in. Neymar. Don't you just love football? Late drama, and now they have the lead. I don't think there's any way back now for the opposition. That looks like the winner. Had to wait a while to get the first goal of the game. He sensed it was coming. It's finally arrived. Looking down at that bench. Barcelona want to make a change now. Great passing. And the crowd really enjoying it. Well, in a game where it will go down to the wire, that could have really been a turning point. But he's missed a chance. He's getting some stick as well off his own fans. And you can understand why. They have individual inspiration, Real Madrid. I think they're going to need that as much as teamwork now to get a goal. To get them something from this game. Well, we're nearly at white hanky time when those fans show their displeasure. But still chance for the Real Madrid players to turn things around. 1-2. And having a little game of their own here. Bale! Well, the pressure of getting his team level maybe got to him because he's made a hash of it. I just wonder whether at the end of this match they'll look back on that chance as the one that cost them dearly. Well, the clock is ticking on. Two minutes of play left. referee has chosen to add on two extra minutes. Sergio Busquets. A break maybe from Barcelona. Sergio Roberto. Wonderful chance! And that's a fantastic goal. It's the substitute who's struck here. And he's done it really to help his team so soon after coming into the game. And that's the win for Barcelona. A few final thoughts as they play. Walker, Kevin De Bruyne, and they're passing so well out there, he could be in! De Bruyne! And he scores spectacularly! A late goal from De Bruyne up, and well that's evaded the keeper's grasp. A really good finish from him. Well it's a goal worth replaying over and over again, isn't it? Had to wait a while to get the first goal of the game. He sensed it was coming, it's finally arrived. When you think about football as a passing game, which it is, you think about players like him. Well they're back defending and they've cut the pass out there, and maybe that will ease the pressure. It's too close to call this, but they've still got a one goal advantage. Chelsea running out of chances now. Well those defenders are going to be asked to... This could be a chance! A chance! He's just reached it, the goalkeeper! Well they know their positions here, they know their jobs defending this corner. And here's the header, got his head to it well, but no power. Well to get there first, to find some space, but couldn't apply the finishing touch. They've worked so hard, the team, to be in front here, this could be it. Pedro! Oh goodness me, it's an equaliser, so late in the day. A late equaliser from Pedro. Well he's hit it hard and he's hit it first time, but perhaps the keeper could have got more on that. Well let's take another look at the goal. So away we go at one all. Well it could have been a shot of significance, it's turned out to be a shot of insignificance. Could have been a selfish decision that one, from the player, when he could have easily passed it. Good one. Well it could have been a shot of significance, it's turned out to be a shot of insignificance. Could have been a selfish decision that one, from the player, when he could have easily passed it. Well it could have been a selfish decision that one, from the player, when he could have easily passed it. The shot's on! Well narrow margins in the match and in this incident. Yeah not far off, that would have made a difference to the outcome if it had gone in. Good one. Good one. Now Fernandinho. Kyle Walker. Looking for Marcelo. And the referee has ended it here. This is a draw, Alan, lots of attempts from one team. Well there wasn't a lot of chances created, Martin Wozner, but on the day they couldn't take them and the strikers particularly would be disappointed. EVERY FLAMENGO MATCH IN THE STATE AND BRAZILIAN CHAMPIONSHIPS ONLY ON PREMIERE Oh brilliant stuff from him, wasn't going to be foxed there. Right into the bottom corner, not just what you want at this stage. And the penalty is Benzema. What a save! All you need to do is put it in the net in the shootout and he's done it. Penalty now, Luka Modric. And the goalkeeper has done well to stop that one, it's potentially the match winning penalty. The goal and the game is theirs. And he's put it away to get the winning penalty. Well it can look easy can't it? And he's made it look easy there. Well there's a goal that's perhaps not gone according to the script here. They've just picked their moment to get forward after a lot of defending. Yeah and they can thank the defenders for that but when they did get the ball they moved it forward really quickly. They were ruthless there. Well you as a top striker in your time you must have appreciated what's happened here with all these goals and how well they were taken. Yeah I think it's been the reward for two sides being positive from the off and as a result we've seen plenty. Yeah."}]}

Any international match is a special match for those involved, nothing quite like playing for your country Andy. Oh it's wonderful Clive, you know when you pull that shirt on whether it's for the first time or the 50th time, it doesn't matter, it's still a great thrill. I suppose you grew up with Brazil and probably the best football team in the world when you were growing up with it? I was a young boy watching the Brazil team in 1970 but they were incredible weren't they? And I think they were the benchmark for everything that was good about the game at that particular time with Pel\u00e9 and Jairzinho and so many top class players and I think there are certain teams every now and again that could span any generation and I think that was one of the reasons why I grew up. Offside, didn't quite get the run right. Hold your run, hold your run, you don't need to run that soon. Luis Gustavo. He's got options here now. He managed to get a foot on the ball and win it. Brazil looking dangerous. Session has been given up here. Ketri. Working the ball well. Tame cross, no trouble getting that one away. Out of the ball, advantage played. Brazil coming forward. Well he can do far better than that, it was a wayward effort but it's just so wet now. Well no excuses for me Clive, players know about playing in the wet, he should have handled that better. Stole the ball there. Brazil won't be taking anything for granted but I can't see them slipping up here. Leinz is flagged, offside, they did an earlier pass. That's a good decision but it was a poor run wasn't it really. They want to make better use of the ball than that. Brazil can do something here. It was a game that was crying out for something to happen and it has. Well it should improve the quality of this match because it's been pretty dull up to now. Can he keep the ball? Has he found someone? Oh that's some save. Refs wait play on, advantage Brazil in possession. Referee's blown now is that a bookable offence? It's a yellow. He gets his name taken for that, he'll have to be careful now. Normally so assured in the tackle but he got that one horribly wrong, that's a yellow. On the ball. Thought that Brazil gets a hard time with this lead still intact, important psychologically. Oh! And he's lost by a decade. That's it, 1-1. Luis Gustavo. Brazil looking dangerous. Not able to get through. He's been tackled. Now Pecluar. Luis Gustavo. Ball's a foul. there will be a minimum of three minutes of added time. What a try! Credit the keeper, made sure he held on to it. Well cut out. Start of the second half and Brazil need to find a little bit more in these next 45 minutes. Very attacking approach here. Oh, the goalkeeper had that. Oh, instant reactions. More pressure here from a corner. Terrific reactions. Nodded on. Couldn't keep hold of the ball. Got it over. Well played in, well defended. Neymar. There's a cohesion about this team now. Now can they make the most of possession? Alert play there, had to make the interception. Luis Gustavo. Oh, he's got to do better than that. He's just rushed that, he's just grabbed at that a little bit, Clive, and that's the reason why he's missed a great opportunity. Defended well. You Well Brazil coming forward Twice he's up Corner to Brazil I Did so well to get that away Brazil could do something here There's a real attacking intent about them at the moment You Pass intercepted Brazil looking dangerous It's a free kick and look where it is Still making it You You Change now You We're into the last ten minutes now time running out looking to thread it through He's had a go Very much in the balance. This could be a vital corner Nobody had any chance of getting on the end of that go right across the pitch You George It's funny, isn't it? I thought this was going to be a bit of a mismatch just shows how wrong you can be quite their plan out there skins It it's a real chance It was a chance a chance miss, but they've got to get that out of their minds now and create another That's important that you stay focused and just keep your composure in a situation like that. That's a good opportunity missed We have reached the last of the 90 minutes Daniel Alves Now the award with the added minutes is about to go up it's three three extra minutes Neymar Really good interception there Can't find a way through the referee is called a halt Walker, Kevin De Bruyne, and they're passing so well out there, he could be in! De Bruyne! And he scores spectacularly! A late goal from De Bruyne up, and well that's evaded the keeper's grasp. A really good finish from him.

Yes it's coming down quite heavily at the moment not sure whether that's going to continue but it's probably a problem for the players actually to see the ball the old orange ball might be out before long. One side with bags of goals the high scoring side in the division and the other team with the worst defense so it should be clear cut here but the joy of football is it really pans out that way. Yeah you would imagine their eyes will be lighting up just got to keep the concentration and do what they have been doing the home team. Here's the lineup so Alan 4-4-2. Yeah I think it looks that way Martin yes it's the conventional shape it's the one that the manager prefers. This is the lineup with the way this manager likes to play that four's going to sit pretty much in place and the two in midfield as well. Yeah that's a defensive two won't be going too far they won't be getting ahead of the ball many times they'll be just trying to feed it into those four lads. Here's the referee Wilson Moutland he's the man in charge today. The referee starts the match and the kickoff. Neal good forward play from them. Rivas they've linked up well. So no chance with that one too high all the way. So so Neal. Now they've got a chance in this part of the pitch. Adrian Winter keeping the move going and in goes the cross. And they're still going backwards all the way to the goalkeeper. Rodgers played down the wing keeping the wide attack going. Rodgers. There goes the cross looking for Gerrard. Well he took no chances there it's a corner. For those who talk about a winter break it's not something that in England that anybody seems to have much appetite for happily. We'll be thinking well this is the kind of weather where you might want to be sitting at home rather than sitting in the stadium. Yeah I think it's worse for the fans really number one getting into the ground and once you're there sat there shivering for the players it's okay you're running about and you're warm. Well he put the signal up there but I don't think the teammates recognized it broke down anyway. Yeah back to the drawing board maybe back to the training ground to practice that one. And it's swerving away all the time from the keeper's grasp no chance for him. He might be through. Winter and a goal. And it's swerving away all the time from the keeper's grasp no chance for him. Let's have another peek at that goal. So and that has opened the scoring one nil here. Here's Gerrard. Giovanni dos Santos trying to get behind the defenders to get in a good cross. Well you've got to compliment him for trying but that's well off target. Well that's another there's another angle coming up here Alan. Well he's just decided to love up that one and uh it's flown into the top right hand corner. Well he's just decided to love up that one and uh it's flown into the top right hand corner. So so and in goes the cross. Oh and goes across Robbie King. Winter. Winter not able this time to add to the goal he's got already. Yeah that one was a poor effort and never troubled the keeper. So it's an exhibition here with such great passing. He's gonna cross it while the ball's gone out for a goal kick. Well there was that attempt that we haven't really analyzed Alan. Let's look back on it now. Yeah had to take it quickly that volley and maybe leaning back that's what saw to him. So so so Mateos the break is definitely on well he's cleared the danger Neil Colin Neil Here's the cross Now here's a chance to show how good they are at corners and maybe increase their advantage Here's the cross And he could get away here Colin goes across He's got his shot off now So it's 1-0 here as the halftime whistle goes Well they've been scoring haven't they, the hosts, but they've been conceding as well So it's been a very invigorating game I must say Yeah not often that those strikers can be kept quiet But doing it for 90 minutes is a lot more difficult Colin He might be through Venter And a goal Colin goes across Robbie Keane Off the post Neil Whistle from the referee And we're off and running again for the second half Giovanni dos Santos Here comes the cross And the ball knocked away long Neil That passing is top class He's made the save Gerrard going into his stride now And it's out now for a goal kick Rivas Neil Gonzalez And in goes the cross Robbie Keane Another one's gone a-begging Which catching isn't it What's that, five, six players that have missed sitters here today And that was the chance to hit the target That's what will disappoint him It didn't even work the goalkeeper All he had to do was keep his eye on the ball Keep his concentration And he's got himself a goal there Neil He's gonna cross it And shoots That is a fantastic goal And the way he's hit that first time You cannot blame the keeper at all Because he's hit it so hard down the middle And that's a goal well worth analysing again Restarting at 2-0 Gonzalez AJ Telecasa We could be in Shots on here It comes out of the goalkeeper And they've got it away from the danger He's put it out It's gone out for a corner Safety first there He's looking for the cross They've got the ball in that wide area there Via the interception Janinho And the cross is in Opportunity now He's gonna blame the snow I think It looks nice watching it come down But it's not too easy to keep your balance on Now one or two of the players looking at the ref inquiringly Aren't you gonna call this off? Get on with it That's a cross the field to try and switch the play Steven Gerrard Key Cross coming in now That's a splendid clearance One of the sides is going to make a change Neal He's put it in well That for sure is a goal kick Activity on the bench for the losing team A substitute getting ready to come off Neal Passed his man there, and here's the shot, goalkeeper can only parry it out. AJ De La Gaza, can they do it in these closing minutes? Oh, he's through. He's got his shot off now. Good work from the keeper. Corner. Change in mind for LA Galaxy, I think. And the ball, knocked away, locked. LA Galaxy have a throw in a promising position. And the manager is going to make a change here. Here's a chance, and that's a fantastic goal. And he's just hit it so hard that it's gone over the keeper's head and he hasn't got time to react. Great angle on it here. Off we go again, 2-1. Well one team has got a much better ratio of shots to goals than the other, that's surprising isn't it? Yeah, they're not stats you'd want your manager to see because they've been wasteful in front of goal. It's a decent cross, and he's headed it goalless on narrow margins in the match and in this incident. Yeah, not far off. That would have made a difference to the outcome if it had gone in. That's great work by the goalkeeper, and there's the last blast on the whistle today. Really bad weather today, really good game. Yeah, we forgot about the weather, only 10 minutes in because it was so entertaining. He might be through, mid-turn, and a goal. Oh, in goes the cross. Robbie Keane. Off the post. Neil, he's going to cross it, and shoots! That is a fantastic goal. Past his man there. And here's the shot. The goalkeeper can only parry it out. Can they do it in this closing minute? Oh, he's through. He's got his shot off now. Good work from the keeper. And the manager's going to make a change here. Here's a chance!  It's a goal. It's a goal. It's a goal."}]}

Messi! First shot, first goal, that's efficiency for you Martin, what a strike The goal for Messi and top left-hand corner the keeper can only wave this one bye-bye Different angle on it here So the first goal, it's 1-0 Lionel Messi Pablo Sarabia He's gonna cross it He can't keep it on the pitch, he's gone out for a throw Javier Mascherano Sergi Roberto Messi! And the goalkeeper has done well to stop that one Aspas He's got that through clever reading of the game, intercepting and getting possession back for his team Opportunity now! And it's just over the bar Verratti Messi They've opened them up here He's gone for it, flashed a boot at it really I think he's unlucky there, you know, because he didn't have any time, the defenders were closing down, so he had to take it early Samuel Umtiti Just a heavy touch, the opposition can take the ball away He's got his shot off now Tight margins, he's just put too much on it It's just over the bar Jordi Alba Ivan Rakitic On towards Messi How will he save it? You can never save your sister When you'll be able to recognise your sister How will you save it? Aspas And that goal... Arrowing it to the top right Another angle on it here So away we go at 1-1 Ivan Rakitic Hernandez Uga Mayo That's the way to win the ball back Good score! Great stop It's a throw in for Barcelona Daniel Vaz Mourinho Well he saw the guy he could switch the play to and came up with a pass as well, excellent It's safe to play it back to the goalkeeper He's good with his feet, well that's very good positional play and he's read the situation perfectly with that interception Deflected behind A clear corner Goal! Well he could have scored So close Goal! It's a diagonal ball to switch the play here Fred Well the ball deserved perhaps a better response from his teammates in the middle The defender got there first though Well he could be in Verratti! And that is the post he's hit and it's a goal kick Cabral Javier Mascherano Lionel Messi It's easy to criticise but his shooting is weak at the moment Barcelona have scored here And here And he was the calmest man in the stadium there to place it to the keeper's right Well they want to see this again this goal Goal! Barcelona then with the lead Ivan Rakitic Half-time start and to go with a wide man well the manager got it right didn't he well didn't he just his teammates you could see in the early stages just kept feeding the ball to him because they know he's the man on song at the moment second half first leg the super cup de espana in spain well the first half didn't quite live up to the billion i think maybe things will change now he's going to cross it looking for leno messi cabral sergi roberto he might be through messi what a fine save coming up now a corner ah and the ball's taken from them they've lost it now so alan what about the first 45 minutes he's played on his debut today got himself a goal but he does need a little bit of a helping hand no little ferrati and that's gone out for a throw in well they're wasting no time with the throw here oh i love the tackle it's gone for a throw he could have been a bit luckier there fred and the cross coming in saramia that is a terrific header unlucky it's just off target they generated some power on it and the keeper wasn't getting there sergi roberto almost ordered his teammate to give it back to him then and that will be a goal kick daniel vas well that's a clever little clip into a teammate the break is definitely on leno messi they've scored a goal for messi and talk about placing it he knew exactly what he wanted to do with it and we can see a slightly different viewpoint on it come on three one the scoreline as we restart the game so good hands bread and butter work really by the goalkeeper but he did it very competently he's having a good game so trying to stretch the opposition using the wider areas here it there's the ball in they cope with it well defensively well they've lost the ball the shot's on you can see the deflection there corner oh comes out with a punch to clear the danger quick header found a teammate he's got a chance to cross and he's barcelona back on the ball now this could be a chance he's in the clear neymar and they've got in to score here a goal from neymar well he's just feathered that into the right hand side that is a wonderful take i have to say it's so one-sided today but all credit to the team that are racking up the goals ten shots six on target for barcelona well they've been okay could have done better but certainly could have done worse here good distance to the clearance then a lot of speculation about the future of danny alves well i can tell you where that future will be he has moved on to bayern munich yeah and i think the fans of this team will be delighted with the acquisition he always gives 100 they put that cross far too close to the goalkeeper he's seen a pass cut it out and in the wing area now can maybe attack cabral fred he's got a chance he's got a chance he's got a chance maybe attack cabral fred they spread it out wide here chance to get some width into this attack fontas fred oh now the referee's seeing that as a foul it is a free kick and it's a headed effort at goal they're not giving up on it despite the number of goals they're behind so it's a quick break and shoots that's a good effort and the referee has now called the halt that's the first leg done and a victory in the first leg of the super cup de espana spain's super cup so nicely set up for the second leg it is it's been an enjoyable tussle down there it's all a part of their fitness regime their pre-season training but we saw some good skills so leo messi your verdict alan smith well so often we think of his creative abilities but a couple of goals here i've won the match for his team you"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a British football commentator. Generate the commentary of an exciting game."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's always good to see international football, isn't it, Alan? It is, and listen, as a player, when you're playing for your country, it's always a huge match, and whether it's a friendly, whether it's a competitive one, for these players, this is a big, big day. And this match today is France, and they play Croatia. Well, this is a match-up between two international teams today. The disadvantage, Alan, is that they don't play together very often. The positive, of course, is they are the country's very best players. They are indeed, and we have got some quality players to enjoy out there today, but as you say, not all of them have played together too often, so there might be a slight lack of understanding at times. And now it's time for the national anthems. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE A lot of interest in how France would line up today. Here it is. Ugo Loris starts in goal. Samuel Umtiti plays with Rafael Varane in central defence. In attack, Olivier Giroud partners together with Antoine Griezmann. Looking at the way Croatia have picked their side for this one. Daniel Subasic starts in goal. Mario Mandzukic is the main striker today. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE WHISTLE BLOWS France have started this first half. WHISTLE BLOWS That's a turnover in play. Attacking now. Mandzukic. Modric. Perisic. To Modric. He's got his shot off now. Hit it hard, but not very true. CROWD CHANTING Rosavic. Modric. Mandzukic. Rakitic. Onto Modric. Gets his foot in there. Griezmann. Lamar. Griezmann. Pogba. Never thought with the pass, with the execution, he was... He's given the free kick, but no sign of the card. Maybe he just wants to make sure he's not made a rod for his own back with an early booking. CROWD CHANTING WHISTLE BLOWS Ivan Rakitic. Mandzukic. There's a dangerous feel to this attack. It's looking good from their point of view. Lucas Hernandez. Lamar. Conte. Mbappe. Came in with a challenge. Mandzukic. Chance to go at the opposition with pace. Delivered into the box. Well, the ball's gone past everyone in the penalty area and out away from danger. Rosavic. Ivan Rakitic. Bersalico. And now he's looking for some support. Rosavic. Perisic. Rosavic. Strinic. Mandzukic. Rakitic. Here's Perisic. Ivan Rakitic. Modric. Looked very good indeed, but the move was broken down. Sidibe. Now he's got the ball. What's he going to do with it? Could be a chance here. They've got the ball into a good area. Griezmann. So the match up here, Anton Griezmann against Ivan Perisic. Well, Anton Griezmann, he's so good at interplay. Just using teammates, using them as a wall. They all want to. As for Ivan Perisic, he is so swift, it's untrue. And he'll take that opportunity to outstrip his man whenever he can. Now this looks promising. Strinic. Perisic. Hacking team not happy about that offside call, but we can see it again here. Well, he is quick, this lad. And he can afford to give himself another yard. I think he's got the beating of these defenders in a race. Rafael Varad. Conte. Mbappe. Olivier Giroud. Coming on strong and looking to play their way through now. Modric. That's a turnover, a possession here. Mbappe. Lucas Hernandez. Vrsaljko. Brozovic. Now here's a chance to get at the opposition. Bit of keep ball going on here. Shimei Vrsaljko. Mandzukic. To Modric. Rakitic. He's had a go here. Well, what a start to the game, that would have been for them, Alan. The first goal coming so early, but not quite. Well, he's kicking himself, he can't believe he's missed from so close in two. Togda. Lucas Hernandez. Well, they're in a good position here. Incisive pass. France get the throw. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. And it's a goal. France get the throw. It's good play until they got that challenge in. Modric. Brozovic. Modric. Kramaric. Well, this attack could have been a menace to it. Modric. He could lay it off to the supporting player. Mandzukic. He must have thought he'd scored from that distance. The keeper had other ideas. Kolar. He's got his shot off now, out for another corner. In goes the corner, Rosevich, Modric, Modric, he's making sure that each pass is going to He's making sure that each pass is successful. When they'll see a chance for a forward pass, they'll flick a switch. Trying to switch on the attacking power in this situation. Defender has to be quick. Good defending. That'll be a throw for France. Sid Ibe. That's a cross the field to try and switch the play. Stopped emphatically and just as well. The approach play looked very encouraging. That's a combination of skill and will to hold off the opposition. Olivier Giroud. Trying to stretch the opposition using the wider areas here. Now he's looking for support. Conte! On to Mbappe. Striding forward purposefully. He's coming forward with some danger. The referee right on the spot there to give the hand ball. That's a good spot by the defender. Samuel Umtiti. Togba. On to the attack now. Mbappe. Good challenge here. Modric. A return ball. For Salihko. Great ball. Played in the clear. The aim is to pick out. The punch here the goalkeeper. Good technique. Togba. Lamar. And here's the shot. What a kick given. Taken by Griezmann. Good defensive clearance there. That's straightforward for Sebastian Gohl. Modric. Attacking now. Griezmann. Mbappe. That's good support as they build this attack. Sidibe. Conte. Conte. Pogba. Hit it hard. But not very true. Ivan Rakitic. Able to cut that out. With some sharp movement. Conte. Intercepted well. I like the look of this attack. It was good play. Until they got that challenge in. Kramaric. Brozovic. Ivan Rakitic. Sime Vrsaljko. It was good progress with this attack. Promising build up. Until that challenge. Could get the ball into the box now. Modric. Kramaric. Trying to catch the other team out with a quick break here. Kramaric. Ivan Rakitic. Could be a chance here. They've got the ball into a good area. Giving the opposition a problem with their interpassing. Griezmann. Conte. Mbappe. Looked very good indeed. But the move has broken down. Brozovic. Sime Vrsaljko. They spread it out wide here. Chance to get some width into this attack. Defended well. Togba. N'Golo Conte. Sidibe. Here's Conte. Really trying to use the full width of the pit. Guided through. Mbappe. Another shot! The goalkeeper can only parry it out. Ivan Rakitic. It's a combination of skill and will. To hold off the opposition. Chorluka. This could lead to a chance. It's good attacking play. Kramaric. Come away with the ball cleanly. Great tackle. Kramaric. Modric. Using his physical power to protect the ball. Olivier Giroud. They're in a good position here. Conte. Giroud. Conte again. Pogba. The shot's on! A real miscue here. Giroud. Olivier Giroud. Kramaric. Put into the middle. Into the clearance. Able to make a good interception. That's great defending there. Stopping that attack. Pogba. Hernandez. Olivier Giroud. France working the ball heavily into a really promising position. Tried to tackle here and he's done that. Mandzukic. So, it's away we go then. Jim, who do you pick out as the telling individual today? Well, I would say one of the most energetic midfielders you'll find in Jordan Henderson. He's added to all that running power with slicker passing and some very impressive finishing, and he's a proper leader now too. Well, quite no argument for me on that one. Henderson gets it back. Castro. Brings it forward. Lallana did well to emerge with the ball. That's a contest to keep an eye on. Into the channel. Firmino goes for the cross. It's Lallana! Oh, he's really drilled it. The keeper felt he had that covered. Some of the crowd were less convinced. It was really well drilled. And it's Man\u00e9. More than happy to take the muscular approach. Now it's Aubameyang. Plays it into the channel. Klein. Castro! Too close for comfort. Man\u00e9! Man\u00e9! Man\u00e9! Man\u00e9 conjuring up some magic on the right-hand side. Oh, great run up to meet it! He's done very well to get to that. Well, what can I say? Truly wonderful goalkeeping. Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Good defending, albeit from an unexpected sort. And the finish! Goal! And Liverpool score first. Oh, high-quality goal. Lovely first touch, sumptuous second. Mauricio Dortmund trail at this early stage. How will they respond? Firmino. Man\u00e9. Man\u00e9. That's really nice. Now, what next? The shot's on! Good stop. That wasn't easy. Well, you can't ask for much more than that. A difficult moment he simply had to deal with. Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Shakespeare shoots! Goal! Goal! Goal! Aimed low and direct. Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Castro goes looking. Royce looking to get on the end of this. Well, when the options aren't quite present in the box, it's the crosser's interest to hold on for the support. He's gone for a throw-in. Now it's Aubameyang. Oh, he's broken through! Threw himself at it, but he's got it cleanly. No complaints about that challenge. Robust, but fair. That's a good block, but at the expense of a corner. So what's he planning here? It's a good run down the left-hand side. Guerrero plays it in. Timely intervention. Castro. Sch\u00fcrrle. He acknowledges that he should have come up with something better there. It was too timid to make it through the defence. He's been bundled over. That is a foul. Matip gets his final warning. This is an opportunity to pull level. It certainly looks appetising. He's gone for goal! That was travelling. Henderson. Looks like a good ball through. He's off on a maraud, looking to shoot. Wonderful from Roberto Firmino! And this is getting better and better. Firmino was quick to move in. Keeper's handling wasn't great. Players like this fella almost have a sixth sense to get themselves in such great poaching positions. How quick-minded was that? Liverpool take a two-goal lead and things should be comfortable from here on in. That second goal has given them so much more command and confidence and they should be able to take it on from here and either add to their lead or close it out. Surely they'll manage one or the other. Castro. Tries to dink it in. Firmino plays it back. And he's there to cut it out. Guerrero. And now the breakaway. Looks to slip it through. Mario G\u00f6tze has a hit! Forward it goes. Is it in? Goes for it! Oh, great save. Real class. Well, that was high-class goalkeeping there to back up his high-class wage. I have to say, that was an exemplary tackle. Stopped him dead in his tracks. Liverpool in control at half-time. 2-0. We're promptly into the second 45 minutes. And it's Royce. Steered out wide. Now here's the through ball. Oh, Bobby Young hits it! He's been taken down and the referee has pointed at the spot. Liverpool have conceded a penalty. And that's going to be a booking. Well, he'd used up all his chances, hadn't he, Peter? I mean, he was never going to get away with that one. Well, I think the alternative was to stand there and do nothing while he tried to score. Obviously, he's not going to allow that, Peter, is he? Eyeball to eyeball with the goalkeeper. Oh, he's hit the bar! Philippe Coutinho. Good challenge. He just stood firm. Oh, he's taken out. That'll be a foul. Oh, that's a booking. Always looked it. Milner, Klein-Aldem, Lallana, Klein, it's a promising run he's making on the right deflected behind for a corner kick Bartra gets it away and it's Wijnaldum, Wijnaldum drills one in Liverpool making a fresh attempt to release someone in behind from back to front and this is something different that had to be more accurate now it's Aubameyang, Wijnaldum Firmino Castro and it's Goetze, he's left his man, played out to the wing Schurrle, heads it, he's done well to get his head on that but couldn't score I have to commend the wing plate but I have to condemn the defending they've got to stop the cross, out to the flank just about up to the hour now Firmino, great challenge Castro and it's Aubameyang, going through, Aubameyang, plays, hits one, it's in well you know thinking about that I think they've perfected that on the training ground because it took them seconds to get the ball from back to front and they really commit forward in numbers too, that was all very well drilled this is threatening to become a really good game, well it was important they didn't get ahead of themselves and lose their, that's an untidy challenge free kick given, well you might think he got off lightly it is just a verbal warning Kutyniuk Kutyniuk, they still haven't hit and that would have been some goal, he almost benefited from some real generosity, no wonder the keepers going nuts, it so nearly came off for him, yeah he's been at the center of a lot of things hasn't he, mostly good I should add, Firmino, this is promising, he's got away Mane, great tackle he had to get that right, Castro plays it forward that's a throw that's not gonna go down too well with his teammates, Castro tries to get it forward quickly, shut a goal, Obadian, goal after glorious goal and it's another really good show of character, I love the spirit and togetherness they muster, never know when they're beaten looking back at that, that's how you play on the counter, quick and decisive and ruthless with the finish, I thought it was a stunning stunning breakaway this has become one superb game of football, look Peter I was on the fence before a ball was kicked and I still haven't moved, a real chance to break he's left his man, now the pass, a chance and Royce, great build-up it all deserved a better ending, Royce surely had to be sharper in making the most of his one-on-one, it's not as if it's his first time either, oh he really wanted that, yeah and you can hear how the crowd are reacting to this too, and it's Royce, he's through, now is he in concentration levels are very good and so is the commitment, this game could yet yield a winner and he's away, driving on, he could shoot here, well they're looking at the referee showing a good level of intensity at this stage, they're calling on all their resources now, goes wide look this can still go either way, it might be flowing one way but there's still time for some ebb Mario G\u00f6tze, little doubt, that is a foul he knew what was coming, that's a yellow card, the players are flocking round their fallen colleague and they look worried Castro, dinks one in Borussia Dortmund merit full marks for their attitude and application in trying to win this, it means an awful lot obviously and it's Royce, out to the left it goes, Castro Mario G\u00f6tze he's got away with one there, well the work rate to win the ball back was fantastic and it set up the opportunity, that's great effort so time, the shot's on, Borussia Dortmund showing a good level of intensity at this stage, they're calling on all their resources now, Mane has got himself a free kick and he's going to have his name taken Klein proving impossible to wrestle off the ball, shoots and a second time and in it goes and surely that's the winner Feyenaldum at his razor-sharp best there, well for me that's just pure predatory brilliance, it's not so much the finish but the way he read the situation when nobody else was even alert to it, that's fantastic Liverpool and that's it Welcome to you from the Wanda Metropolitano, this wonderful stadium newly located here in the heart of Madrid and home to Atletico Madrid since the start of the 2017 season. And here we have Serbia against Brazil. I'm Peter Drury and here with me in the commentary box, I'm glad to report, is Jim Begley. Hi Peter, always good to work with you. I'm really looking forward to this now. The trains of the National Anthem of Brazil. Serbian National Anthem. Serbia line up in a 4-5-1. Yeah, it's a formation geared to make life tough for the opposition, though they can't afford their front man to become a bit detached and isolated. And we're on the way. So Jim, tell me this, who are you looking for in particular here? I would think the midfield giant Nemanja Matic. He can play as a third centre back in front of that defence in a destructive role or drive his team forward with his constructive passing. He's gone for it! Goal! Brazil! First blood drawn. Brazil are really pouncing on any stray passes in midfield. We're talking seconds from interception to the back of the net. It's counter-attack in heaven. Brazil have an early lead. Good start. Out wide to the right. Cross stitch. Lobbed it in gently. And that'll go straight through to the keeper. Philippe Coutinho. Marcelo. Some good play on the left hand side now to profit from it. Tadic. Kolorov. Tadic. Who's he going to play in? Plays it out to the flank. Tadic battles to win it back. Shoots! Had a swing, but it wasn't to be. Well that was inventive and speculative, but the thought process was a little slicker than the attempt. Philippe Coutinho. Dashing forward at pace. Plays it into the channel. Well positioned to make that interception. It's Douglas Costa. Lucavina gets his foot in there. Brazil have hit the front early. A foothold in the game. Always when you score early, it gives you such a lift and it casts doubt in the minds of your opponents at the same time. And that pretty much sums up the difference in what we've seen. One team assured, the other a little unsure. Massive leap! He will be livid with himself. Mitrovic. Tadic. With a long pass out wide. He's got options out wide. Great tackle, he had to get that right. Coutinho did well to emerge with the ball. That's a contest to keep an eye on. He's brushed off the ball there. He was thinking about headlines, I'm sure, but he ought to focus more on breaking lines. Tries a through ball. And it's Paulinho. Casemiro. A really good feet from him. Is it in? Sticks in a foot to win it back. Douglas Costa. Casemiro. Goes through the middle. It's a great ball. He'll have it in! Yeah, that's top defending in preventing him turning, which can open up many possibilities. Mitrovic goes up and over. He's gone away. A full-blooded challenge, and it had to be. He is not one readily to admit defeat. Don't be surprised if he tries that again. He's made certain that won't get through. And it's Tadic. Dicks one in. Tadic looking to get on the end of this. And he just whacks it away. Looks like a good deal through. And a shot! More pressure on the opposition goal. This is proving to be a very good spell. The intensity is great, but they've got to make it count. It so nearly came off for him. But that's the motivation and enthusiasm he shows and the quality he produces. Mitrovic. Coutinho brings the ball forward. Has a swing at it! It's in! It's in! It's in! It's in! It's in! Has a swing at it! It's in! Two up now, and they are cruising. Look, there just wasn't much of a gap to begin with. And to find it, I think it was a fine drive. And I don't think the keeper could have really planned for that. He's a bit unlucky in that instance. It's in! It's in! It's in! It's in! It's in! It's in! It's in! Brazil take a two goal lead. And things should be comfortable from here on in. Well, at 1-0 this contest was still nicely poised. But now that it's gone to two, mindsets are affected a lot more. Going for goal! Douglas Costa. Douglas Costa. He's lifting it over. He's lifting it over. There's no flag. Steered in. Gets up to hit it! Oh, just couldn't turn it in. Now that was a slick move. And there were several options in the box to pick out. There is the halftime whistle. So your views on the first half? Well, it's looking pretty straightforward, Peter. They've got themselves into a very good position. So why dither from here when they can repeat their first-half success with another show of strength? Brazil sitting pretty here at halftime. 2-0 up. So we're just settling back into this second half. Casemiro. Right to Taulinho. Over to the left. Taulinho. Forward it goes. Breaks on here. Looks to slip it through. Now here's the through ball. Going through. He's had a shot! Oh, no shortage of confidence there. Well, the run was really impressive. The finish was depressive. And expectations were not met. Into the channel. Neymar is demanding it out wide. Neymar! It's being played forward. Great strength. Too strong for his opponent. He's failed him there. Matic is now in the last-chance saloon. Yeah, and he has to change his ways, or this referee could soon change his status. Neymar! Oh, it's come off the upright. Someone looks like he's in need of protection here. Yeah, and if they're going to try and... Mitrovic is the guilty party there. Jean Miranda. Taulinho. Philippe Coutinho. Coutinho. Danger averted for now. And he's cut it out. A little accusatory stare there tells the whole story. Ah, quality deserted them when they really needed it. Tries a through ball. The flag has stayed down. That's one way of trying to make things happen. There's a few who could follow that example. It's Neymar! More and more and more and more. They are running riots. And surely that settles it. Oops, he's now gone and removed his shirt. And that's going to earn him a booking surely. Serbia, that was where they were about to make a change. Yeah, just confirming, Peter, that Neymar received a yellow card for removing his shirt. Yeah, well that was inevitable. Three without reply. This is becoming a stroll. Lajic. Stared out wide. He's left his man. And it's hoisted clear. Chance to shoot. Looking to shoot! Oh, the keeper's done just about enough. I'm not sure what he had in mind. I don't think he knew either. Stich defending, but that'll do. Tadic hits it back. Tadic decides to play. Has a hit! He's kicked it out just. Do I really need to tell you, Peter, that he has to do better? Especially from there. Shoots it out of Holmes' way. It's got through and has a shot! Good challenge, he just stood firm. Neymar. Alinho passes it through. Douglas Costa. Costich. And it's Casemiro. That's a foul. Brazil looking to widen the gap even further here. It certainly looks appetizing. Neymar! It's bounced out! This could fall anywhere. And he should have made it four. His instinct was brilliant, but not the finish. Neymar. A hefty challenge, but fair enough. Good clearance and very necessary. Philippe Coutinho. Tried to play it through. That just required a bit more oomph to reach its target. Matic plays it out to the wing. Threw himself at it, but he's got it cleanly. Brings it forward. Rooker View. He needs to get it forward quickly. Serbia going about it patiently. Perhaps too patiently. Now the pass. Helps available out wide. Great leap! Alinho goes looking. Douglas Costa passes it through. He acknowledges that he should have come up with something better there. Douglas Costa clearly is miffed having made the run and not get picked out. Well intercepted, really alerts the danger. Going through. He's taking on the lot of them. Dinks one in. Keepers ball. Casemiro gets it back. Looks like a good ball through. Shoots! And that may well be that. That is that. Brazil have won big and in style. Everything went for them. Their poor opponents left chasing shadows."}]}
