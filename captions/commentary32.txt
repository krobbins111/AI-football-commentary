Fred that's his game is  there intercepting  we'll try again it's gone again  [Applause]  Mississippi he rated the game for this  team to get one go was excellent but now  they've doubled their money  [Applause]  let's take another look at the girl  [Applause]  just widen the margin here to to nil  there was a Manchester United Chelsea  game at Stamford Bridge towards the end  of the 1415 season Chelsea did win the  game imagine I'd had all the ball there  was a most unusual smash and grab from  Josie Marino's man yes he parked the bus  at home almost there didn't he to get  the job done as they edged towards the  title trying to find an opening not  panicking got the tackle in he could  clear it here  matéo cover Chooch  and that's going to be a goal kick  [Music]  right down the wing keeping the wide  attack going looking for teammates in  the middle he had to clear it even at  the expense of a corner here it is again  another look at Murata's go corner  played it it was a promising situation  that could have made more of that  Chelsea give it away saw the pass coming  and got there first  [Applause]  Haeju NASA had out in front of gold  [Applause]  could tell the keeper was pleased with  that and why wouldn't he be at the top  draw that same Lukaku  good reading of the play by the defender  [Applause]  the money of mattock  was whipped here for Manchester United  now the cross has gone behind for poor  effort  [Applause]  coverage  Marcus Alonso really trying to use the  full width of the pitch here to make  some progress  Hayden has her gives it away with Jesse  lingard the man yet mattock  trying to catch the other team out with  a quick break here hope ur incisive pass  [Applause]  well they were caught out here by this  quick counter-attack against the run of  play yeah I mean they had to stick  together there and come under a lot of  pressure but with the pace in the team  that was always lightly  if we go again to one  Murata Allen guard  like us alongside motel cover Cheech  the chance to attack  [Applause]  across this cause the defense any  problems is certainly not the goalkeeper  slipping it through his Linga gets his  cross in and they get it away  Alexis Sanchez  and goes out wide again they've been  thrown out after the tackle  well then it goes very straightforward  piece of goalkeeping as he catches the  cross  [Applause]  they passed not completed really  Valencia crushing it here moving from  one side to the other  opportunity to cross it now he works so  hard on his heading needs to do a bit  more well to think yeah Anna keepers  waving that one bye-bye big Greta  content Matteo coverage as a Murata  excellent vision  [Applause]  well they managed to get out of harm's  way that because it looked as though it  was going to be some real damage done to  them  popa trying to put his team made it saw  the pass coming and got there first  it was gonna be three minutes at a dog  [Applause]  Murata  he's sure  want to they're tight now  well this is half-time that's the  whistle and Here Come Manchester United  right at the start of the second half  [Applause]  Papa there's an easy cut out for the  opposition saw the past coming  yes Willie  [Applause]  defenders managed to get in the way  there  [Applause]  talk about  [Applause]  Romelu Lukaku  now Paul Pogba walked off the path there  good performance so far by Ed NASA will  be happy without fur we kept conceded by  Antonio Valencia clearly a booking  outcomes the yellow car when he reached  straight through his pocket he didn't  really think about it but I think that's  the good court towards them involved  here Virginia  good position for the cross  [Applause]  it's one back that's good movement  forward here  [Applause]  shops drop very quickly to another  corner that deflection  72 Mary place Barney let's run some  water  swung in from the corner the mantis  by the goalkeeper  [Applause]  Lindelof Sanchez Alexis Sanchez stay  true just nicked it away from the  attacker the goalkeeper  Jesse Linga and here comes the support  [Applause]  that he's one of the best in the  business from those got a situation  absolutely brilliant goes to corner  takes charge here from the corner  [Applause]  coming up  substitute coming on to try and repair  the damn  [Applause]  matéo cover Chooch  anticipated the direction of the pass  and is able to intervene  delivered towards Murata defended well  tonio Valencia  but true-bypass yeah Lukaku  but how did Manchester United miss that  one they're still trailing well he'll  get some stick off the fans if they get  nothing for this match that's been a  greater my tale cover Chooch  it has it  as a fastest man  very straightforward save for the  goalkeeper  he's sure sure  [Applause]  Alexis Sanchez he spotted a teammate and  has got the technique as well as the  vision to switch to play  delivery to the far post that's a  brilliant volley it deserved better just  clipping the frame of the goal or the  crowd enjoyed that one on two feet we  people each scored with it  I'm gonna contact  cottage gone out over the touchline  that'll be a throw to the opposition  Chris Smalling  [Applause]  Bigelow  Romelu Lukaku sure crushing it here  moving from one side to the other  Palencia  Anthony Marcia  there's a drive and some power but  off-target yeah I'm looking quite get  set for that one  absolutely quitter  Marcus Alonso a test for the durability  of Chelsea here to hold off Manchester  United in these closing minutes but I've  got some across the defense any problems  are certainly not the goalkeeper well I  have played in a controlled way Chelsea  winning at half time they still have the  lead  Manchester United need to find some  fighting spirit here there a goal down  we've got 10 minutes left on the clock  putting a bit too hard trying to force  the pass in it straight to an opponent  I've worked so hard the team to be in  front here  and that's been recognized by the  supporters yeah I think they recognized  that it has been a really good  performance but still a bit of work to  do  at each  [Applause]  but get his got it now Cote  that's a good book  Sanchez  Alexis Sanchez guided truth Lukaku  [Applause]  Mateo cabotage Marcos Alonso as a  the other content  [Applause]  poverty  a class act isn't a player's  given aside yeah he's playing on the  shoulder that just needs to hold his  monitors  one minute left on the clock  [Applause]  as a final whistle it's a win for  Chelsea  hard thought this wind to very evenly  matched teams here sometimes it feels  even better than if you were to win  three or four nil  it has out in his usual impish form here  today it's one thing picking this lad  out to try and stop him it's another  thing actually accomplishing that feat  he's in really good form another goal  and another win for his team
