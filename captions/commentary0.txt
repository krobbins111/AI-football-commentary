involved in the rivalry  here Barcelona and Real Madrid well what  an atmosphere inside the stadium and  what a match we should have star-studded  lineup see you in front of us  [Applause]  Barcelona score plenty they don't allow  the opposition to score hardly any they  get it right at both ends of the pitch  they've got some good individuals at the  back and they've also got a  understanding across that backline  [Applause]  it's a real group mentality in this line  up about pressing the opposition into  making mistakes and cashing in on it  straight away well it takes a lot of  energy a lot of motivation it's easy to  drop off and when you do drop off that  we need aggressive closing down that's  when it can fall down  [Applause]  Barcelona's lineup here mark and Rita  Stegen starts in gold gerard piqué  starts with Samuel MTD is the center  backs even racket each place with any  esta in the middle Luis Suarez is the  lone striker today  enjoy the game  well you're too young Alan but I grew up  watching Real Madrid win those European  crowns and the 50s when European club  football only just started and they made  such an imprint on pretty much  everywhere where the television pictures  were beamed in those days and they've  just moved on from strength to strength  well quite simply they're one of the  most famous football clubs in the world  aren't they perhaps the most famous  [Applause]  able to cut that out with some sharp  movement  Avon racket ish  on the move and able to cut out the pass  [Applause]  now casimiro  good play until they got that challenge  in  even rocket ish  sergio busquets it's a combination of  skill and will to hold off the  opposition on the attack here  we saw the look from the other player  and saw where the pass was going and  read it Barcelona awarded the throw here  Sergio Busquets  even rocket ish Suarez  now it messy  [Applause]  that's very good shielding of the ball  all right  this is shut down  I cut out by Cristiano Ronaldo  a great real Madrid hoping for victory  here good knowing that it might not just  be simple tasks  one or two tackles early on he's given  the free kick here he's gonna get his  message across the rest  [Applause]  Jordi Alba  [Applause]  moderation  here's casimiro i don't know whether the  managers told them to do this but  they're just defending deep and saying  to the opposition you can have the ball  you're not going to hurt us right  forward a bit of menace in this attack  Gareth Bale stop the opposition gets the  ball out of harm's way  on to Ronaldo  here's a chance to attack  Cristiano Ronaldo gotta shut off now I  was so close to going inside the post  but it's just straight past the outside  yeah I think you've beaten the people  you know but just not got it within the  framework of the goals and he's a bit  unlucky the manager just hoping that  that miss is not going to come back to  haunt them they are creating chances but  that was a costly miss  Dembele  luiz suarez it's got some strength has  knee to shield the ball like that into  the attacking third  Iniesta just making sure that each pass  is successful when they'll see the  chance for a forward pass shots on here  great save  so the corner to come another look at  that effort on goal from Cristiano  Ronaldo well only he will know whether  he was going for goal there in the end  he nearly scored  and any goes Bush gets  raphaël Varane using his physical power  to protect the ball his casimiro clothes  ESMA  quick-witted and quick in this movement  to to intercept their Jordi Alba  Iniesta  they're not messy getting forward well  as a team now promising build up until  that challenge Real Madrid still trying  to get an impact on to this game  I'll say this is a chance around Madrid  from this corner  [Applause]  [Music]  we've gone short with the corner  you can lay it off to the supporting  player all about picking the right bass  now as he cuts it back  these refuse to be beaten here well  standing ovation from the fans had why  not wanna stop real madrid get the  corner  [Applause]  corner from Tony Krause good defensive  clearance there and now Messi Iniesta  luis suarez  [Applause]  Podrick gross good football between  these two nice passing Sergio Roberto TK  it goes out wide too messy  modrich is casimiro  truth  moderate  Tony Krause  as a combination of skip the break  behind them now Luis Suarez  falling behind from Suarez  backing his own skill as the opposition  trying to nip the ball from him  men Shabbat Cristiano Ronaldo need to  try and get the ball back now Benzema  Iniesta  and the times we added on here is a  minimum of three minutes three minutes  Real Madrid looking good with this  attack  here's casimiro Tony crows come away  with the ball Clinic great tackle  Marcela  now though  now casimiro  Ilana's halftime and the score is nil  nil here  very well match first-half very  enjoyable and the visitors well they are  level at halftime but that normally  rock-solid defense has been rocky yep  goalless and I just wonder whether we  will see that net bulging at either end  in the second half  [Music]  all about picking the right bass now as  he cuts it back  [Applause]  [Music]  and here we go with the start of the  second half  say to you Roberto  even rocket itch  now Messi he has been pressed there to  running the ball out of play  Sergio Ramos in control that's Toni  Krause always knows what he's going to  do with the ball before he receives it  really getting at the opposition this  far up the pitch now  pulls it back now test again showing  great reach great reflexes the corner  side any key that would be paired off  in from Krause really away from the  threat here  is casimiro  well  it's gonna shut off now the goalkeeper  comes out with a punch  Sergio Busquets  luis suarez lovely football typical  Barcelona  this pissed away by the keeper  the Jordi Alba  I've got numbers in this attack and it  looks dangerous  Podrick  Tony throws on to ronaldo partridge  is casimiro  Tony crows no great danger here but  they've got the ball that's the most  important thing  Roderich no wonder that the OIT because  what five six seven players involved in  that field that I all play an integral  part that was wonderful  [Applause]  he has put that where it's impossible  for the goalkeeper to reach it right up  into the top corner from the deepest  wouldn't have gotten hands on now let's  take another look at the goal  [Applause]  I think the managers decided he wants to  play a great individual reception but  she wouldn't get at the final whistle  [Music]  [Applause]  now it's van den belly getting forward  well as a team now  luis suarez  Jordi Alba  Dembele now it's Suarez leonova say  that's a good block you're gonna get a  corner here because of that deflection  activity on the bench for the losing  team a substitute getting ready to come  off  [Applause]  right away well away from gold  piqué  Dembele tried to tackle here and he's  done that  moderate the tone of this country he's  go now it Benzema go they lead by two  now I feel a little bit more comfortable  good value for this advantage at the  moment great strike into the area where  no goalkeeper in the world would have  kept that out he's been on food today it  looks like this toy gun on table he's  going another angle on it here  though he's loving it the manager who  seen his team playing really well just  what he was asking for  restarting a tunnel even rocket issue  Bush gets some potential in this move  quick-witted and quick in this movement  to to intercept that mod rich well  look very good indeed but the move is  broken down  Palli Nia  luis suarez little private game between  the two of them  and the attacking now coming from  Barcelona you went in well Dembele  shots on here  Barcelona's winning a corner coming up  the pool a loft is the goal scoring  midfielder

defending  his ESCO how that cellar  and they've cut it out  good idea Pass not executed with enough  subtlety really the run was a good one  even rata ticks that's good movement  forward here  Church the shop gets blocked  matéo coverage  a player's a bit unhappy about this so  we can see it again whether it should  have been offside or not it was cold  outside who'd be a linesman but these  lines but he's one of the best and he  gets it right here  casimiro entire Kovacic his ESCO  this is what you expect from real madrid  casimiro  well it's just a footnote to the match  really it confirms
