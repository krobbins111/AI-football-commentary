first a high quality goal lovely first  touch sumptuous second  [Applause]  Borussia Dortmund fail at its early  stage how will they respond famiy No  [Applause]  money man a that's really nice now what  next  the shuts on could stop that wasn't easy  well you can't ask for much more than  that a difficult moment he simply had to  deal with  [Applause]  shake the shoots  aim blow and direct

from Roberto Firmino  and this is getting better and better  the amino was quick to move in Kieffer's  handling wasn't great our players like  this fella almost have a sixth sense to  get themselves in such great coaching  positions how quick minded was that  [Applause]  Liverpool ticket to go lead and things  should be comfortable from here on in  well that second goal has given them so  much more command and confidence now and  they should be able to take it on from  here and either add to their lead or  close it out surely they'll manage one  or the other  [Applause]  Castro  [Applause]  tries to dink it in Firmino place it  back and he's there to cut it out get  arrow and they'll the breakaway  [Applause]  looks to slip it through Mario kertzer  has a hit  for it goes is it in  goes

pointed at the spot Liverpool have  conceded a penalty and that's gonna be a  booking well he'd used up all this  chances hadn't he Peter I mean he was  never going to get away with that one  well I think the alternative was to  stand there and do nothing while he  tried to score and obviously he's not  going to allow that Peter is he eyeball  to eyeball with the goalkeeper  oh it's hit the door  [Applause]  Philippe Coutinho could challenge he  just stood firm  [Applause]  let's take it out that'll be a foul  [Applause]  that's the booking always looked it  [Applause]  build up  fine Eldon  lalana klein some promising run he's  making on the right deflect it behind  for a corner kick  [Applause]  bar truck gets it away and it's fine  album via album  chills one in Liverpool making a fresh  attempt to release someone in behind  from back to front and this is something  different that had to be more accurate  [Applause]  now it's oppa Mia  fine Eldon  Cimino  [Applause]  Castro  and it's good sir he's left his man  played out to the wing schürrle heads  it's still well to get his head on that  but couldn't score I have to commend the  wing plate but I have to condemn the

[Applause]  well you know thinking about that I  think they've perfected that on the  training ground because it took them  seconds to get the ball from back to  front and they really commit forward at  numbers too it was all very well drilled  this is threatening to become a really  good game well it was important they  didn't get ahead of themselves and lose  their did  that's an untidy challenge free-kick  given well you might think he got off  lightly it is just a verbal warning  [Applause]  [Applause]  continue who still hammered it  and that would have been some goal he  almost benefited from some real  generosity no wonder that keepers going  nuts it so nearly came off for him yeah  he's been at the center of a lot of  things hasn't he mostly good  I should add famiiy know this is  promising he's gone away  man a great tackle II had to get that  right  Castro plays it forward  it's the throat  [Applause]  that's not gonna go down too well with  his teammates Castro  it's nice to get it forward quickly  sugar gold Oh bunny goal of the glorious  goal and it's another really good show  of character I love the spirit and  togetherness they must never know when  they're beaten  looking back at that that's how you play  on the counter quick and decisive and  ruthless with the finish I thought it  was a stunning stunning breakaway  this has become one superb

driving or  he could shoot here but they're looking  at the referee but he's worse he Altman  showing a good level of intensity at  this stage they're calling on all their  resources now throws wide look this can  still go either way it might be flowing  one way but there's still time for some  ed  [Applause]  Mario götze little tell that is a foul  [Applause]  he knew what was coming that's a

winner  vine Eldon at his razor-sharp bash there  but for me that's just pure predatory  brilliance it's not so much to finish  but the way he read the situation when  nobody else was even alert to it it's  fantastic  [Applause]  Liverpool and that's it
