[Music]  you  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  coming up for you on EA Sports a beeper  presentation on Nintendo switch I'm  Martin Tyler  along with Alan Smith I just wonder as  we look ahead to another North London  derby whether Tottenham are concentrated  too much I'm trying to catch up with us  and just play the season as it is and if  they finish it I've asked the world  great that's happened because they've  had a good season well that's right we  often talk about a shift in toe what we  see might be a shift in power at the  start of the season but hasn't quite  happened yet has it  well much of the 1617 season  surrounded for Arsenal in the debate  about the future of arson Bangura then  defined his critics by winning the FA  Cup yes and a fine performance it was at  Wembley that day the fans will want to  see them kick on from that when I'll  still moved here they put up the dates  of the club's successes around the  stadium but for a while there was  nothing that it actually happened since  the Emirates have been the home ground  but of course in 2014 and 2015 they won  the FA Cup on both occasions and they'll  be hoping that opens the floodgates in  that respect I think that's what this  ground is missing history  [Applause]  on a travel attire to find space in the  box there  young talents around Germany's measure  özil such an elusive little customer  wonderful ability to pop up in the box  another angle on it here  and that has opened the scoring one  there's good progress with this attack  [Applause]  that's taken the heat out of the  situation for the moment with that  interception  [Applause]  I'm given the throat that's fine go I  want to see it again I bet you do too  well yeah I think he will want to see it  again as well tonight great finish  don't cuss yell mate  [Applause]  trying to find Alexis Sanchez great work  by the goalkeeper the ball is his these  made sure he's protected it  [Applause]  first get the referees advantage Mousa  dembélé  [Applause]  in front of go club right sister  but ask them the keepers pulled up and  really good save but that's when he  needs the help of these defenders  [Applause]  analyzing again  restarting at tuna  [Applause]  cane  Aaron Ramsey  I've got the ball in the middle of the  pitch here  the tackle there is successfully done  granny checkered  Ramsey  well you can see what he was trying to  do but the past wasn't on it was a bad  ball as it turned out  [Applause]  and he fused his head there to keep  aside in possession they've linked up  well he shut off a decent effort just  just off target yeah unlucky because it  got some power beyond the ball just not  the direction  I'm Annie Chaka  back again  Mousa dembélé Sanchez  Aaron Ramsey  excellent way to lose mocha  [Applause]  Mousa dembélé  [Applause]  song  [Applause]  really trying to use the full width of  the pitch here to make some progress  Christian Eriksen that's the way to win  the ball back  [Applause]  banana checker  sachit  [Applause]  proper clearance well away from the  danger zone well that's a good block  that's an easy interception because the  past wasn't really a very thoughtful one  casi la that's a fine tackle Mesut özil  [Applause]  that's a good challenge between the two  of them there Mousa dembélé  [Applause]  Alex oxlade-chamberlain  Aaron Ramsey  [Applause]  can hit it here  you might be needed again he didn't hang  on to the ball  [Applause]  come on ichika  [Applause]  shut up fine save he's made there and  he's not let the ball escape his grasp  [Applause]  Alexis Sanchez  [Applause]  sachit goalkeeper hangs up  that is a cheap piece of player to give  the ball away like that  and the tackler has been very successful  there he's got possession  [Applause]  okay  the referee is blown for halftime its to  nil here after all the talk the players  are trying to walk the walk and it's  been difficult as you would expect in a  derby at the moment one team a little  happier than the other and you can feel  the tension within the stadium but in  the crowd understand so here we go for  the second half  Aaron Ramsey  safely away  oh sorry cold  that's a good call yeah I think it was  and in the end not a difficult one  because there was a couple yards in it I  think  like I said  whereas a clever little clip into a  teammate read it well  [Applause]  like I said he's gone in strongly and  got the ball referee sees that as a foul  and it is a free-kick  like a set  opportunityto Gazette terrific stop  [Applause]  it's a corner for [ __ ] here  [Applause]  strong powerful clearance and our store  have possession they've wallet  [Applause]  came  well you can see what he was trying to  do but the past wasn't on it was a bad  ball as it turned out  taught them who are going to make the  change  [Applause]  Oh cake to come  for the losing team  getting ready to come on  so Victor worried Yama  granny Chaka  Sanchez  the referees giving it  [Applause]  and from the Spurs sidelines a  substitute is going to come on well  that's very good positional play and  he's read the situation perfectly  without interception  like a set  [Applause]  here's the chance out confrontive go  [Applause]  song  [Applause]  help ease the pressure  Sanchez  [Applause]  if you look at the coaching manual you  don't defense gonna try to fight save  [Applause]  [Music]  to make a change and being behind you  can understand that  [Applause]  and it's a headed effort ago  [Applause]  [Applause]  I'll be all the wider  [Applause]  davus  terrific jackal  there's L crossing good stop by the  goalkeeper  [Applause]  guided on by his head and they've got  the ball still  [Applause]  right on the shoulder of the last  defender he's just got to get it right  it's all about timing  I still have the ball again like as it  [Applause]  Mesut özil  crushes in tight margins it just put too  much on it it's over the bar  [Applause]  able to make a good interception  well we've had some chances how long but  it's awhile since we've had a goal  they've still got the lead yeah and  they're knocking the ball about we're  gonna pay a bit of confidence and they  look pretty secure with this lead at the  moment that could soon change though of  course  to get goals haven't I  the manager thinks is to get another  attacker or foul called against Arsenal  Christian Eriksen came right down the  wing keeping the wide attack going  [Applause]  well this pulled up there that could be  a pulled muscle  go kick here  [Applause]  [Applause]  with the way his team have played so far  but he's going to make a substitution  here just to hope that he can retain  this league  [Music]  we're down now to the final two minutes  of the 90 and he's moved in trying to  jostle the opponent of his stride  [Applause]  like a set  Theo Walcott we're hearing there will be  300 minutes here Theo Walcott  Alex oxlade-chamberlain  Coran ichika  davus  well he's wonderful well forward here  [Applause]  site  this could be what they call the  insurance goal couldn't it to make sure  of the victory to turn a one-goal lead  into two and that no time for recovery  really if they were to get the goal we  could clear it here  [Applause]  so I'll have wallet  bragging around the town now  this victory over the  neighbors go out shopping now rather  than the losers it will be highlighted  at home and it for the next three days  [Applause]  [Applause]  [Applause]  [Music]  you
