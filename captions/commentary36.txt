Oh  you  you  hello once again I'm Martin Tyler and  this is Old Trafford  where's Liverpool against Manchester  United a girl of a certain age you'll  remember when Liverpool were top dogs in  the 70s and 80s and Alex Ferguson came  down from Scott will try and change that  he did Manchester United obviously in  the last decade of the last century the  first decade of this century he got what  he wanted but that rivalry still really  exists it doesn't if you ask the pliers  and particularly the fans they will say  this Derby is the one they looked to at  the start of every season  featured played for us today is planned  matter yeah and quite light - I think  he's one of those that went on top of  his game he really he's difficult to  stop because he pops up in those areas  finds those pockets of space  Roberto Firmino he's got priceless  ability on the ball he can manufacture  in tight spaces this is then the  Manchester United liner having the  highest arcing goal asked enshrines  dagger at Michael Carrick in the middle  and at the point of attack  just one lone striker  this is the Liverpool side-seam a mini  lay starting goal artists kurtal start  with a and love run as the center backs  and rach and plays with Lucas in the  middle Christian benteke is the sole  striker today  for long period this was a place where  Manchester United seemed to be totally  unbeatable then they've had one or two  changes of management of course we  should always likely to happen when I  like focus retired after so many years  the visitors have been able to come away  with points which they would never have  expected to get in the past yeah maybe  the fear factor has diminished and it's  up to the manager that's in place at a  time to try and build up back up again  for my part never scored here safe  what's the favorite ground of mine  to fit me nope  stop the attack here building  it's across  good play one on one it's good movement  they're getting forward here Manchester  United good play but they've lost the  ball now the opposition could get at  them it'll be a throw  sure  nothing wrong with that tackle in fact  it was a terrific effort it was a good  season 1415 for Manchester United they  did the league double over Liverpool and  they became an Old Trafford and  Liverpool actually played really well  but it would be three nil and that was  actually the start of kids a great work  by the keeper corner for Manchester  United  the lady days ago  go here now the keepers pulled off her a  really good save but that's when he  needs the help of these defenders  so the first goal is one nil and no  score excited  I'm 16  gomez  lovely  James Milner  Delaney  and he preached it well Emery Chan  Laughlin  gomez  and the throat with a bit of urgency  about it keep the attack going Daria  trying stagette  Eleni  good position they've worked this attack  very well until quite a dangerous  position now  ha  Eleni  James Milner  every channel  moved around nicely here with this  passing go  look clear the danger  that's coming in now  that will be a corner for Liverpool now  the chance to see Carrick's goal  and the goalkeeper coming up his line  he's got that through clever reading of  the game intercepting and getting  possession back for his team across his  blocked and in goes the cross and he  claims the cross from the flags up he's  frustrated because he is caught offside  maybe he made his run a bit too soon  and the cross comes in now  James Milner  we had a good look at that decided it's  just a TRO hearted attacking I'm very  confident to get the game moving again  trying to Liverpool  Nathaniel Klein skirt or  that is a free cake  was an easy decision for the ref when it  needs and saw the ball and he thought  you could win it but just as a faction  off  only two more minutes to be added on  he's met it with his head he's off  target and that  really was a big moment the equalizer  was beckoning but it wasn't a simple  chance but it really deserved a bit  better than that finish so it's one nil  here as the halftime whistle goes  well I like the look of this from the  neutral point of view Alan we're going  to get an extra attacker on for the team  that's done the better attacking that  are leading in the game now I want to do  sigh the best form of Defense his attack  and that's the principle he's taken here  the manager Michael Carrick  and decade  Christ I get  Lucas  James Milner back to him again Roberto  Firmino it's a free-kick against  Manchester United  a good skill just to lift a ball there  at the right moment well the player but  we're featuring here is done well he's  certainly been an influence on this  first half well he played really well  didn't he and he got himself a goal to  put his team ahead he'll be pleased with  that first 45 minutes lovely  Manchester United with the ball again  and Avera  substitution for Liverpool referee says  free-kick  well they're still trailing and they  need to do something now if they want to  get back into this game maybe some fresh  legs will do the trick  Nathaniel climb skirt is a cheap piece  of play to give the ball away like that  which finds target  really on top of their game now  wonderful understanding  shut up let's come up hip in with Hanna  and go  go burn for Manchester United oh that's  a lovely poachers gold  johnny-on-the-spot - tapping hope  that's why the margin here to jail  not a good challenge by the defender  spaced across the ball now let's see  useful ball in  it's all I've got a new man ready to  come on  that's the pass that's gone astray out  of clay  James Melda  Nathaniel climb  definitely a throw in there  Michael Carrick cut out the pass  intercepting if you like and now can go  on the attack maybe freshening it up  live a talk with the substitute now  we'll be dealt with easily by the  defenders there wasn't the great cross  in truth now they can build from the  back your position we are in the last  chance to learn to Liverpool all the  manager on the sidelines has made his  intentions clear he's waving quite a few  defenders forward I'm just going to get  that ball into the box whichever way is  possible  mata  and take it  in the skirt oh and it's a shot that the  goalkeeper can deal with quite  comfortably  trying to Liverpool  Loveland 18  or dispossessed that could be in trouble  try it  great save by a diving goalkeeper the  cross coming in when the ball deserve  perhaps a better response from his  teammates in the middle the defender got  there first though  wasteful pass unforced error really  Nathaniel Klein  schedule  that's a good challenge between the two  of them there and about up  in Memphis and he's not hitting with cow  has he but he's certainly hitting with  accuracy  little surprising that it is as  one-sided as this late in the game but  the team leading deserved the margin of  what's going to be a very comfortable  victory we're down now to the final two  minutes of the 90 skirt Lee oh just one  minute of added time to come Lucas  possession in the midfield area  he wants to play on the shoulder of the  last defender just got to get it right  it's all about timing  that's full time right  good seeds of 1415 for Manchester United  addicted shits a great work by the  keeper
