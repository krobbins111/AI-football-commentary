positive  of course is they are the country's very  best boys they are indeed and we have  got some quality players to enjoy out  there today but as you say no Lola  played together too often so there might  be a slight lack of understanding at  times  number ten  [Music]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Applause]  this is the lineup for the hope side  he's going to defend with six isn't he's  going to have those two holding midfield  players and that the other four go and  attack when they can yeah I'm in the two  lads in the middle the two midfielders  are naturally defensive minded players  Martin so I don't think now naturally  get forward to willingly so yeah it  looks fairly cautious lineup this is the  away side Sergio Romero plays in goal  Nicolas autumn ending plays with Javier  Mascherano as the centre backs a verbum  ager plays alongside Lucas billion in  the middle of the park  Mauro Akari is the sole striker today  it's Portugal to kickoff  [Applause]  Costa

 philia  philia  an attack from Argentina Federico Fazio  Ava Bennigan's  B Leah still passing I'm not really  making inroads philia messy the Caddy  pulls it back now  [Applause]  go back the Interceptor got it for them  DeMaria  trying to pick out Messi defend it well  a trans Silva  here's Cristiano Ronaldo Portugal  attacking now typical Ronaldo he wants  to take them on  they want to

hasn't come easily delighted  with it is a well crafted home try and  finish at the end of it  well he said it up in the back of the  net quite high up to if I'm not sure  when we actually meant it just to go  under the bar maybe we'll find out  [Applause]  [Music]  [Applause]  real pleasure for Portugal they've got  this lead happy a masculine Oh  billion  Federico Fazio  backing down  far too close  across to the kaepa  [Applause]  edit down to a teammate  philia  Akane trying to slip it through comes  out off the goalkeeper Pepe is clearance  how to play for a TRO  Cedric  but are those silver  [Applause]  I say that here we've got a free-kick  given by the referee  [Applause]  bill yeah  Picaro Acosta clever ball in on the  goalkeeper shot gets blocked  look from the other player and saw where  the past was going and read it  Ava bonaga  played forward a bit of Menace in this  attack  going to go great goalkeeper great save  well he shouldn't about a prayer there  but he's so agile these people  it's a nagger Accardi  it is an equalizer that looked on the  cards I must say as the game went on you  just wonder whether they would get  frustrated but now they're in a position  having equalized to go on and try and  win it  fantastic from the neutral point of view  that the game is level again  [Applause]  good luck here again by the replay of  the goal  [Applause]  so away we go at 1:00 or now a giant  silver so here we are at halftime and  it's one one  a player but we're featuring here has  done well he's certainly been an  influence on this first half well really  good late equalizing goal and that might  just change the managers team talk now  [Music]  and the kickoff it's Argentina for the  start of the second half  Ava Banega  philia and here's some attacking play  from Argentina  it counted Lucas big  Federico Fazio a threat at the moment  but they have got the ball and that I  suppose is a threat messing it has to be  very quick  Cavalia here's Cristiano Ronaldo  Portugal attacking now not a good  challenge by the defender in a great  position to pull it back  [Applause]  [Applause]  centering  cut that out well well-read  [Applause]  that can be quick on the break now Akari  philia  Ava Banega Messi Bacardi DeMaria  Mona given to Argentina  gonna plate into the middle well they  just got the ball away it's another  corner  let's have another glance at that save  oh that is wonderful stuff  [Applause]  and it's taken  very close in Allen but not very close  to story yeah a simple save in the end  and it should have been anything but he  should have been picking out the dead  the keeper is shall Mario jamario and  the attack coming from Portugal  [Applause]  Renaldo  that'll be a corner  it's gonna be a change for Portugal  [Music]  Paul has taken disappointed that that  didn't lead to more into the gloves of  the goalkeeper the hardest thing he'll  have to do today by any means  [Applause]  philia  [Applause]  Acosta  trying to switch on the attacking power  in this situation  promising build up until that challenge  is Cristiano Ronaldo  and I've copied out  they know Messi  [Applause]  Lucas biglan  now with messy  shut up well just  sit on a porch go fetch with the  substitutes  [Applause]  it's message corner cleared away by the  defender that's good support as they  build this attack  and the referee is given the free cake  it's Bernardo Silva  now danila  now here's a chance to get at the  opposition team yo with good fishing  [Applause]  hvala in opposition of pressing high up  the pitch but they're keeping the bull  they've got enough numbers back  [Applause]  alongside  that's it  [Applause]  right moment is decisive moment in the  match we feel sure  and here he was faced by the goalkeeper  that was the challenge in you go easy as  you like it looks easy doesn't it but I  can tell you it's not you have to be at  the top of your game to joy and to  convert  [Applause]  [Applause]  well a very exciting climax to an  exciting game this could be the decider  well it could be any stage in an  accident see much of a  be decisive  it's going to be a minimum of three  minutes to be played of added time  excellent play to attack in this late  stage they haven't given up yet  by the whistle  please to win the match I guess because  that's what you do whenever you play but  as a friendly game more than just a  result for them I think so now take a  lot of heart from that because not only  did they win but they played well along  the way so Leo Messi your verdict  talents with when they had a good  performance and snatched that light goal  to grab the win
