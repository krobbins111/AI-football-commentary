you'll  remember when liverpool were top dogs in  the 70s and 80s and alex ferguson came  down from scotland to try and change  that and he did manchester united  obviously in the last decade of the last  century the first decade of this century  he got what he wanted but that rivalry  still really exists yeah it doesn't if  you ask the players and particularly the  fans they will say this derby is the one  they look to at the start of every  season  manchester united have certainly  improved defensively and statistically  they have the best defense in the league  it's a wonderful asset to have isn't it  on the road coming to a ground like this  and to know that you really have got a  good defense  [Applause]  when you played here alan did you touch  that anfield sign on the way out or was  that only for the home team that is  strictly only for the home team martin  [Music]  [Music]  [Applause]  this is the liverpool side sima minilay  starts in goal nathaniel klein starts  with alberto moreno as the fullbacks  philippe coutinho starts looking to  continue his great form in midfield and  today it's just the one striker in the  side  [Applause]  this is then the manchester united  lineup david de gea starts in goal eric  plays with phil jones in central defence  paul pogba plays with  central midfield romelu lukaku is the  sole striker today  [Applause]  can't talk about liverpool to you  without mentioning anfield in 1989 and  that glorious night for arsenal well  back then nobody tended to win at  anfield i know it's not so easy to  appreciate now but it was a fortress  i'll be hoping to get back to those kind  of times  pogba  mata  guided through by henrikh mkhitaryan  just to keep a debate  and that's dealt with the problem  [Applause]  quick  now this looks promising  and they're keeping the ball that's the  important thing  he's got a chance to cross  antonio valencia  crossed in towards rashford comes out  with a punch to clear the danger  that's a combination of skill and will  to hold off the opposition he can cut it  back now  that's a corner from manchester united  [Applause]  he's put in the corner  well that will mean a corner coming up  now it's a terrific save isn't it from  simon mignolet let's see it again  there's a master at getting his angles  right he's near this goalkeeper  put the corner in the middle  [Applause]  [Applause]  mkhitaryan swung it  [Applause]  he's taking a chance but he's keeping  the ball under some pressure  getting forward well as a team now  good screening and he's kept the ball  right from the kickoff they look like  scoring they have now sharp from the off  and what a good goal  from close range  he took full advantage it's a proper  striker's goal that one he gets just as  much satisfaction out of that as a  20-yarder  [Applause]  [Applause]  liverpool have the lead here  [Applause]  mata  liverpool  [Applause]  petinio  album  cut out the pass  [Applause]  mata lukaku  and he's got the ball away from him with  the tackle  it was a good season 14 15 for  manchester united they did the league  double over liverpool although the game  at old trafford i mean liverpool  actually played really well but they  were beating three nil yeah that was  actually the start of some good months  wasn't it for liverpool and rogers  before it tailed off towards the end of  the season  lukaku off the post  [Applause]  [Applause]  [Applause]  joe matty  [Applause]  jordan henderson  there's a dangerous feel to this attack  it's looking good from their point of  view  i  [Applause]  coutinho  now sadio mani  well read by the defender  henrikh mkhitaryan  [Applause]  on the attack here  [Applause]  well the sprint could be on here for  wynaldo  henrikh mkhitaryan  they tried to keep it but they haven't  been able to do that  nathaniel klein  [Applause]  i think  he can't have scored many better than  this  with the bend he's imparted onto the  ball i'll give him credit you could see  exactly what he set out to do there and  executed it perfectly  [Applause]  well i know this manager has been  working hard on the training ground on a  certain shape and boy is he getting  results out there  just widen the margin here to two-nil  mata  [Applause]  jordan henderson  [Applause]  return pass an advantage for liverpool  can they take advantage of that decision  that's great defending there stopping  that attack  now marcus rashford  henrikh mkhitaryan  [Applause]  mata  could be dangerous  now mkhitaryan  mkhitaryan's target is in the middle  there  [Applause]  nathaniel klein  very good forward thinking from  liverpool always on the front foot  [Applause]  we've got to clear it now promising  build up until that challenge  lukaku  three minutes to be added on  roberto firmino  read the play well to intercept  [Applause]  good  defending  doesn't want to get caught in possession  here  [Applause]  weinaldo  muhammad salla  and it's there for liverpool  well scoring in any game is worthy of  celebration when you get to it is  special  and he is feeling that special delight  at the moment different angle on it here  [Applause]  well this is delightful football from  liverpool today  [Applause]  and the referee has signaled for  halftime  3-0 is the scoreline at this point  only one team in it  as we head for half-time only one team  in it the other team  they are struggling well wildly  different team talks i think from the  managers  one's got an awful lot of work to do the  other one will be saying same again  please lads  [Applause]  crossed in towards rashford  [Music]  you don't often get a first half as  one-sided as this one they've been very  good the team that are leading of course  that's caught the defenders out it's a  great run and a good pass  [Applause]  lukaku with rashford again  looking to make an opportunity either  for himself for a team mate  quick witted and quick in this movement  too to intercept there  [Applause]  joel mati  moreno henderson  wynelda  nathaniel klein  bit of space to go forward into with the  ball  [Applause]  crisp defending there  [Applause]  rashford  henrikh mkhitaryan  lukaku  he's fouled by diane lovren  yellow here for lovren  [Applause]  rash alan reckless when you attempt to  slide tackle like that you've got to  time it perfectly  manchester united  manchester united want to make a change  now  [Music]  [Applause]  [Applause]  very good distance to the clearance  jordan henderson  [Applause]  roberto firmino  they've got numbers in this attack and  it looks dangerous  [Applause]  it's a day he'll never forget  what are days having  three goals now he's been a thorn in the  side of the opposition all match and he  thoroughly deserves that hat-trick  [Applause]  well i think this manager was  pessimistic coming into this game and uh  those fears are being realized now his  team trailing by a good margin  [Applause]  i have to say it's so one-sided today  but all credit to the team  they're racking up the goals  trying to switch on the attacking power  in this situation  well we thought we were here for a very  even contest allen but hasn't panned out  that way at all it hasn't i mean you  look at the two sides man for man  there's not much to choose between them  but i think tactically the team lead in  here has been a bit more cute lukaku  wonderful save  had to really reach out for that  substitution now for liverpool  [Applause]  got his head to it well but no power  welter to get there first to find some  space but couldn't apply the finishing  touch  that is a cheap piece of play to give  the ball away like that  i think he saw the look from the other  player and saw where the pass was going  and read it  [Applause]  anticipated the direction of the pass  and was able to intervene  roberto firmino  onto the attack now  into the box it goes along the  ground now mkhitaryan  [Applause]  jordan henderson  he must have some sixth sense to  anticipate when that pass was going they  looked in but he's defused the danger  liverpool are going to make an  alteration to their lineup from the  bench  nathaniel klein  coutinho  coming on strong and looking to play  their way through now  it's delhi blind  [Applause]  now anthony martial  on the defenders  [Applause]  shots on here i'll give him credit for  having a go but he was nowhere near the  target yeah he took responsibility  and he'll be hoping better next time  [Music]  [Applause]  jones  [Applause]  now anthony martial  [Applause]  it's money  quick passing from liverpool to open up  the opposition if they can  and then he goes with the tackle  [Applause]  valencia that's cut out  [Applause]  sturridge  mata  [Applause]  antonio valencia  and uh herrera  it's delhi blind  [Applause]  well this attack a little bit of menace  to it  [Applause]  still on the attack and they've got a  corner  [Applause]  and then it goes we've got his fist to  it  it looks like being one of those games  where the liverpool keeper is not going  to get beaten trying to get the cross in  nearest defender blocked it  [Applause]  good screening and he's kept the ball  good forward play from them  he points to the spark penalty  penalty given but no extra punishment  for the culprit yeah i think that's fair  enough i mean it was a foul but he's not  denied an obvious goal scoring  opportunity there  well you run the risk when you go to  ground like that with a slide tackle of  getting into serious trouble all right  it's a definite foul martin just a  slight tackle but he just mistimed it  badly  and puts away the penalty  [Applause]  no worry about the pressure or the  responsibility here and there's the goal  yeah i think some people are cut out  some aren't this lad certainly is  [Applause]  four one is the score line  [Applause]  most defenders will be furious with that  because they were seeing the game out  quite comfortably it seemed but a little  bit of loss of concentration they've  lost a goal yeah maybe you can  understand it it's been so uh easy for  them out there that they've taken the  foot off the  gas he's spotting it up now to take the  corner  excellent performance from the team the  supporters know that the job is pretty  much done and they're just loving it i  don't think we'll get them out of the  ground at the end well they've been  treated to some really good football  haven't they some good goals and uh  appreciative of that  very good distance to the clearance  could be dangerous  well it was a foul and he's given the  free kick  ah  [Applause]  [Music]  ah  [Applause]  [Applause]  this could lead to a chance it's good  attacking play  makes the challenge here  and uh  and that  is the end it's all over  it was absolutely  extraordinary exceptional elegant  excellent  well he goes across and grabs the match  ball from the ref the hat trick and  that's to be treasured by any player  [Applause]  [Applause]  good screening and he's kept the ball  money  [Applause]  i think  [Applause]  not a good challenge by the defender  money  and puts away the penalty  [Applause]  [Music]  you
