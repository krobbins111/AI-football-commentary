 hello everyone  Martin Tyler here Alan Smith with me as  usual welcome to you to today's game  it is a brilliant brilliant fixture it's  always been that way other factors as  well as football involved in the rivalry  here Barcelona and Real Madrid well what  an atmosphere inside the stadium and  what a match we should have star-studded  lineup see you in front of us    Barcelona score plenty they don't allow  the opposition to score hardly any they  get it right at both ends of the pitch  they've got some good individuals at the  back and they've also got a  understanding across that backline    it's a real group mentality in this line  up about pressing the opposition into  making mistakes and cashing in on it  straight away well it takes a lot of  energy a lot of motivation it's easy to  drop off and when you do drop off that  we need aggressive closing down that's  when it can fall down    Barcelona's lineup here mark and Rita  Stegen starts in gold gerard piqué  starts with Samuel MTD is the center  backs even racket each place with any  esta in the middle Luis Suarez is the  lone striker today  enjoy the game  well you're too young Alan but I grew up  watching Real Madrid win those European  crowns and the 50s when European club  football only just started and they made  such an imprint on pretty much  everywhere where the television pictures  were beamed in those days and they've  just moved on from strength to strength  well quite simply they're one of the  most famous football clubs in the world  aren't they perhaps the most famous    able to cut that out with some sharp  movement  Avon racket ish  on the move and able to cut out the pass    now casimiro  good play until they got that challenge  in  even rocket ish  sergio busquets it's a combination of  skill and will to hold off the  opposition on the attack here  we saw the look from the other player  and saw where the pass was going and  read it Barcelona awarded the throw here  Sergio Busquets  even rocket ish Suarez  now it messy    that's very good shielding of the ball  all right  this is shut down  I cut out by Cristiano Ronaldo  a great real Madrid hoping for victory  here good knowing that it might not just  be simple tasks  one or two tackles early on he's given  the free kick here he's gonna get his  message across the rest    Jordi Alba    moderation  here's casimiro i don't know whether the  managers told them to do this but  they're just defending deep and saying  to the opposition you can have the ball  you're not going to hurt us right  forward a bit of menace in this attack  Gareth Bale stop the opposition gets the  ball out of harm's way  on to Ronaldo  here's a chance to attack  Cristiano Ronaldo gotta shut off now I  was so close to going inside the post  but it's just straight past the outside  yeah I think you've beaten the people  you know but just not got it within the  framework of the goals and he's a bit  unlucky the manager just hoping that  that miss is not going to come back to  haunt them they are creating chances but  that was a costly miss  Dembele  luiz suarez it's got some strength has  knee to shield the ball like that into  the attacking third  Iniesta just making sure that each pass  is successful when they'll see the  chance for a forward pass shots on here  great save  so the corner to come another look at  that effort on goal from Cristiano  Ronaldo well only he will know whether  he was going for goal there in the end  he nearly scored  and any goes Bush gets  raphaël Varane using his physical power  to protect the ball his casimiro clothes  ESMA  quick-witted and quick in this movement  to to intercept their Jordi Alba  Iniesta  they're not messy getting forward well  as a team now promising build up until  that challenge Real Madrid still trying  to get an impact on to this game  I'll say this is a chance around Madrid  from this corner      we've gone short with the corner  you can lay it off to the supporting  player all about picking the right bass  now as he cuts it back  these refuse to be beaten here well  standing ovation from the fans had why  not wanna stop real madrid get the  corner    corner from Tony Krause good defensive  clearance there and now Messi Iniesta  luis suarez    Podrick gross good football between  these two nice passing Sergio Roberto TK  it goes out wide too messy  modrich is casimiro  truth  moderate  Tony Krause  as a combination of skip the break  behind them now Luis Suarez  falling behind from Suarez  backing his own skill as the opposition  trying to nip the ball from him  men Shabbat Cristiano Ronaldo need to  try and get the ball back now Benzema  Iniesta  and the times we added on here is a  minimum of three minutes three minutes  Real Madrid looking good with this  attack  here's casimiro Tony crows come away  with the ball Clinic great tackle  Marcela  now though  now casimiro  Ilana's halftime and the score is nil  nil here  very well match first-half very  enjoyable and the visitors well they are  level at halftime but that normally  rock-solid defense has been rocky yep  goalless and I just wonder whether we  will see that net bulging at either end  in the second half    all about picking the right bass now as  he cuts it back      and here we go with the start of the  second half  say to you Roberto  even rocket itch  now Messi he has been pressed there to  running the ball out of play  Sergio Ramos in control that's Toni  Krause always knows what he's going to  do with the ball before he receives it  really getting at the opposition this  far up the pitch now  pulls it back now test again showing  great reach great reflexes the corner  side any key that would be paired off  in from Krause really away from the  threat here  is casimiro  well  it's gonna shut off now the goalkeeper  comes out with a punch  Sergio Busquets  luis suarez lovely football typical  Barcelona  this pissed away by the keeper  the Jordi Alba  I've got numbers in this attack and it  looks dangerous  Podrick  Tony throws on to ronaldo partridge  is casimiro  Tony crows no great danger here but  they've got the ball that's the most  important thing  Roderich no wonder that the OIT because  what five six seven players involved in  that field that I all play an integral  part that was wonderful    he has put that where it's impossible  for the goalkeeper to reach it right up  into the top corner from the deepest  wouldn't have gotten hands on now let's  take another look at the goal    I think the managers decided he wants to  play a great individual reception but  she wouldn't get at the final whistle      now it's van den belly getting forward  well as a team now  luis suarez  Jordi Alba  Dembele now it's Suarez leonova say  that's a good block you're gonna get a  corner here because of that deflection  activity on the bench for the losing  team a substitute getting ready to come  off    right away well away from gold  piqué  Dembele tried to tackle here and he's  done that  moderate the tone of this country he's  go now it Benzema go they lead by two  now I feel a little bit more comfortable  good value for this advantage at the  moment great strike into the area where  no goalkeeper in the world would have  kept that out he's been on food today it  looks like this toy gun on table he's  going another angle on it here  though he's loving it the manager who  seen his team playing really well just  what he was asking for  restarting a tunnel even rocket issue  Bush gets some potential in this move  quick-witted and quick in this movement  to to intercept that mod rich well  look very good indeed but the move is  broken down  Palli Nia  luis suarez little private game between  the two of them  and the attacking now coming from  Barcelona you went in well Dembele  shots on here  Barcelona's winning a corner coming up  the pool a loft is the goal scoring  midfielder he's gained a good craft and  the fans here love him because he always  puts it on to the center    Carlini oh very good distance to the  clearance  here's Cristiano Ronaldo Marcela Matteo  cover Chooch  Conover how well this attack got a bit  of Menace to it  Benzema that's great work by the  goalkeeper  Sergi Roberto Messi  looking for Jordi Alba in the middle now  that's good defending  his ESCO how that cellar  and they've cut it out  good idea Pass not executed with enough  subtlety really the run was a good one  even rata ticks that's good movement  forward here  Church the shop gets blocked  matéo coverage  a player's a bit unhappy about this so  we can see it again whether it should  have been offside or not it was cold  outside who'd be a linesman but these  lines but he's one of the best and he  gets it right here  casimiro entire Kovacic his ESCO  this is what you expect from real madrid  casimiro  well it's just a footnote to the match  really it confirms the wind yeah make  the golf school would be pleased another  one for for his tally light on the match  here  well we're in the last few minutes now  and tomato pie has been cast in this  game really rocket ish  that's it  Sergio Ramos  it's finished here          about picking the right bass now as he  cuts it back      pulls it back now      this pissed away by the keepers  danger here that they've got the ball  last well rich      Pisco now with Benzema Ronaldo      this is what you expect from Real Madrid  massive arrow  we start around Madrid    
 this is the Allianz Arena the home of  Bayern Munich big welcome to you all  from myself Martin Tyler and from Alan  Smith Alan well it radiates European  history doesn't it it's a wonderful  fixture for us we're lucky to be here  Alan Bayan against Vasa  yeah soon as this draw came out I've  been looking forward to the type and I  don't think we're going to be  disappointed with a football on show  here  look at these two robert lewandowski  against little mystic what do you expect  in their mouth  but madoski he's a top-class finish up  he gets himself in the box and it's not  often that he loses his head as for  little messy he's known food into  blazoning those little given those  cheeky ones with teammates he just can't  keep up with him  by medics lineup and while lawyer starts  in goal mats Hummels plays with Jerome  Boateng its central defense Thiago plays  with Arturo Vidal in the center of the  park robert levin dosti is the main  striker today  Barcelona's lineup here mark Andre tests  against us in gold  Jared pique starts with Javier  Mascherano as the center backs and he  has the plays with Sergio Busquets in  central midfield Luis Suarez is the lone  striker today while you talk about  Bernie Baio being your favorite stadium  around the world I think this is one of  mine the Allianz Arena because it's  great for commentating much much closer  to the action than we used to be in the  older Munich Olympic Stadium you never  forget walking up here for the first  time he woke up in 2006 and it looked  like a spaceship and it lights up in  different colors as well doesn't it it's  amazing arena  maybe a masher  Sergi Roberta he's coming forward with  some danger  a total Vida real individual charge here  with the ball he's still going nicely  played through ball he's got his tackle  in the balls gone out now on tour I'll  be down at the ball when defended to it  first  they bar  onto the attack now  and jump the challenge i catching  football really it just got to a stage  where they actually took the eye off the  ball literally and had lost the ball  here's a chance to attack  to find an opening not panicking  to Bayern Munich    well they're in a good position here  trying to find one mullah it's Thomas  one of installed here  no surprising that  it's an awesome goal it's come into the  long way out since in that angle it's  not always easy to finish defenders  called out by in the end more ELISA he's  a fantastic head over the ball and he's  not stood no chance there  open the scoring what they'll hear  Barcelona  temptation to that play on advantage  Sergio Busquets even racket inch  right down the wing keeping the wide  attack going building steadily here  keeping possession trying to find Suarez    the goalkeeper  and now any Esther and the attacking now  coming from Barcelona  well let's have another look at that  because it was a very very tight call  they were in otherwise when I saw it  first time of asking I thought he was on  you know but looking at the replay what  a good decision from the linesman that  was robert levin dosti here's a chance  to move forward from midfield after that  interception looking good this move  looking for an opening with some good  the shuttle  very good stop here  corner now for Barcelona  oh good through ball to level it up MSA  he's done it again    well very nice levi stellan beautifully  done he's almost passed it into the net  jimmy greaves like there isn't he  good luck here again by the replay of  the goal so away we go at one all vamos  David Alaba  likes a challenge here Sergio Busquets  they bar Jordi Alba  we couldn't expect a very interesting  match here with Barcelona looking for  the victory but they could be matched  all the way now rebury  doing well to keep the ball    but now any está  here's the shop the prime of the gold  good defending and noia saves  comfortably    Iniesta  get his foot in that  and the time to be added on here is a  minimum of three minutes david alaba  good pass it forward  Peter sentiment and it's a henna  this will be a corner  Munich let's have a look at this Alan  what's your view on it the attempt from  Suarez I think he's actually trying to  find the roof of the net you know  without side foot but just lifted it too  high to the bar  intercepted well  defending that on the referees well the  action resumes now with Bayern Munich at  the start of the second half la  a lot of defenders between them in the  goal but they still got the ball tried  to tackle here and he's done that well  they've got to chase back because with  the turnover in possession they could be  vulnerable  he's coming forward with some danger  well they've been thwarted here that's  the sign of better things to come by  Minich ready to bring on a sub  it's messy  ow shot blocked here for that look  promising  that he's been stopped levin dosti  robert levin dosti    and they've cut it out they're going to  start from the back cause it's a back  pass to the keeper is everybody  and if barcelona back on the ball now  damar luis suarez and barcelona on the  attack that passing is top class  neighbor  it's another decent try with crystal  level in this match    and it's been an hour of very good  football here we've still got 30 more  minutes to go and I'm sure we're going  to enjoy that as well  Bayern Munich are ready with the change  this is an exercise in patience as they  try to get an opening little mess a  terrific stop  Barcelona winning a corner  well you can see what they were trying  to do just a bit too much height on it  it's gone straight to the goalkeeper  fast learner get the throat  Leonel messy even racket in challenges  I've got the ball back Barcelona  well the building steadily here working  away depended to it first    by Munich given the throg  as the quick check on the clock 20  minutes to go the feet the bench is  buying or making the move with the  substitute into the attacking third  it's good play until they caught that  challenge in  here's the chance to get in the cross  he's a very good finisher as well  as that colors just shown well he's not  to knit from almost on the line itself  well we do up and say  don't think she could be step  a substitute for buying meeting a Suarez  spits it back again  yoshua Kimmage the two teams were going  to play on here but the referee has  stopped it for this dinger  while the inter player has gone off  we're going to get the game restarted  with a drop ball  it's noticeable that the home supporters  trying to help the team in this  situation they're encouraged by the  leave but they fearful perhaps that this  team might lose it I don't want to give  anything silly away the opposition of  chasing the ball trying to get it back  and trying to get back into this match  the charity came back on that with any  thunders trying to get the cross it well  walked by the defender there is some  backup for him in this position    trying to buy and beating  David Alaba  right from the beginning we'd never know  which way this game is going to go on it  it's kept its drama right to the last  could be dangerous  I need to try and get the ball back down  i catching football really it just got  to a stage where they actually took the  eye off the ball literally and lost the  ball  saved  there it is the final whistle confirming  victory for by Vinick  I wanted this friendly game to  get themselves going again they'd lost  the game  Pantages that perhaps the result will  suggest they were trying out one or two  things there that didn't quite come up  but manager might have finding it quite  useful to see which of his players could  adapt
 now this is the part that they press in  Paris welcome to it to all of you I'm  Martin Tyler and a big welcome to my  colleague and friend Allen Smith Perry  San Jamar today involved in our match  against Barcelona    I'll be keeping an eye out for those  runs towards the near post from Edinson  Cavani loves to get two corners in front  of defenders and score a lot of goals  for clubs and for country like that  yeah very strong in the air sure that is  something that the opposition manager  would have spoken about to his defenders  before this match well we expect you  know Messi to be the master of the ball  and probably the master of the game as  well well he's obviously the man to  watch and the man to mark interesting  hair the opposition do try and cope with  him I've seen him man marked out of a  game before but not many times  Perris a shaman since their line up in  goal Alfonse areola jagger silver-plated  makinia since central defense and  general rabiot plays with Marco Verratti  in the middle Edinson Cavani is the main  striker today  looking at the lineup it's got all the  components in place has made the manager  for the pressing style of play that's  been a feature of his team yeah and many  an opponent is fairly difficult to cope  with if your touch isn't spot-on against  this aggressive type of closing down  you're gonna lose it in dangerous areas  this was where France got one of their  first real trophies a nation that  produced people have invented the game  like jewelry May and on read-along I  invented competitions as we know it  today and the Champions League European  Cup came with French origins and France  won that 84 European Championship trophy  the beat Spain to nil yeah plenty of big  games memorable games here you used to  see the look be Union here as well  before they moved across to the junta  France and now NES day even racket ish  Jordi Alba there's a dangerous feel to  this attack it's looking good from their  point of view  defender has to move quickly grab you  they bar  and yes that  they'll fail  moving forward with some danger to the  opposition now they're here  we intercepted    grabby oh this how they love to play on  the break name up the offside player  he's havin little go at his teammate he  did want that pass earlier  any esta Jordi Alba and the bull return  to any ester tackle here  nice cut that out well well-read    Jordi Alba  even rocket H  nice wallet with some potential in this  move but on the move all the time and  makes lots of these interceptions  Bharati  now dani alves  luis suarez  they buy  yeah Bo    he's got the ball there in the defensive  zone by reading the play very well on to  the attack now  Plus goes towards the far post that's a  great finish for the first goal of the  day    it was a move to make your mouth water  great goal  I think he's picked him out from that  left hand side wonderful delivery really  an accurate cross but he's just got  ahead of his marker pure and simple and  he wanted he more  showing his frustrations the manager I'm  sure he'd love to be out here playing  himself but he can't and his team are  losing now Barcelona then with the lead  Bharati Thiago Motta  Flavio  Edinson Cavani  attacking now  we don't see that so often just glided  past him effortlessly it's messy    Bharati  over the top towards Neymar  trying to hit Cavani in the middle the  safe by mark and racist Aegon    piece of interplay between the two  hey Bob  onto a map a  Danny Albers Cavani to get level here  well he certainly was good move to and  give him another chance I think he might  take him  he knows Hitler manager a golden  opportunity to get back on level terms  that was really slap honest Joker and  now NES day  Leonel messy day Lefou dick shade safety  first from the defender can't blame him  for that    damn ballet  what an opportunity if he picks out the  right man full extent should the  goalkeeper makes the save  well I might not be rushing to take the  core nada a goal to the good of course  played in by Messi DK led away by the  defender tight against the touch line of  pretty clear that was going to end up  with a throwing the Suarez the deeper  position pretty happy there and he's got  possession on the move and able to cut  out the pass  yeah I got my top  now here's a chance to get out the  opposition  body    Bharati  and the verdict on added time is two  minutes he's very confident with the  pool at his feet a chance to break away  now on the counter    some sharp movement on the referee is  signaled for halftime and it's one nil  here well the player but we're featuring  here has done well he's certainly been  an influence on this first half well he  played really well didn't he and he got  himself a goal to put his team ahead  he'll be pleased second half underway  Barcelona have got the lead  trying to stretch the opposition using  the wider areas here    all right  pre-kick given    how's it go here the goalkeeper  we've just anticipated the direction of  the true king anticipated well  gem rabiot  giving the opposition a problem with  their inter passing now dani alves  piqué then Bailey threads it through  there could pose some danger now that's  a wonderful tackle  that's it    Ashima I'm ready to make a switch now    messing on to jordi alba back with messy  mess a saved by the goalkeeper at full  stretch    lately intercepted    he's coming forward with some danger  Cavani it's a goal in that level    really couldn't miss from there well the  keeper had no chance  I want to see this again this go      Iniesta is off  so away we go at one or even rocket ish  Vantage applied there for Barcelona  moving forward with some danger to the  opposition now they're here they are  Javier Pastore the ratty who slipped his  man    Paolina now Bessie  it's got it back again from his teammate  it's messy  incisive pass into the attacking third  has taken a touch there of the defender  it will be a corner having played the  advantage he's now going back to deal  with the infringement that he could have  blown fought and the offender's going to  get a yellow card yeah I wonder whatever  we thought he got away with that because  the play was allowed to go on but no he  sees yellow and goes to corner  good defensive clearance there  Bank LD Maria pavani  keep the ball at the moment pk    they know Messi    tacky well here  sit back now    he looked the goalkeeper in the eyes and  said right I've got the win here and  he's got the goal to show that I love  that kind of finish when you don't have  to blast it as long as the placement is  right      go conceded and they are losing at the  moment Perry Sasha man  here's Makino's bank LD Maria  well he makes that transition happen  quickly  trust in the truth box hidden heart and  love  now took the chance nicely that really  has given them much more of a basis for  the rest of this match    go keep the left totally isolated here  and the two attackers just worked it  past him  for a simple goal yeah they used the  heads the lug in possession didn't try  and go for glory he knew when to release  the pass and he did just that just to  remind a31 it is now the scoreline  karate live across our now Dani Alves  attacking now here's Danny Galvez    Izawa pavani  a shot now well they've all gone - the  defendant has say well done but I think  the guy who had the chance really should  have scored well he had the chance to  get his shot away even though he had to  take it quickly sure job better and the  manager Alan is making this change here  substitution will take place wonderful  to watch he took those two goals  superbly well    stared true that's a decent stop but not  perhaps one for the top ten nobody was  on his toes listening he was ready for  it and it can take possession in his own  half Thiago Silva he's cut that out well  well-read Andre Gomez in comes the  challenge Flavio  they don't mess a  Barcelona awarded the throw here  that's it good fishing he's tried to hit  this one too hard Alan has me oh I think  he shanked it Martin miles off target in  the end  Lucas Perry San Jamar smoothly through  the gears here neighbor  - Andre Gomez  karate Danny Elvis  DeMaria gotta shut off now go go  that assistant there he was certain the  flag went up straight away    lay no messy Andre Gomez  getting forward well as a team now good  vision  and the goalkeeper across to it last the  end of the game    please to win the match I guess because  that's what you do whenever you play but  as a friendly game more than just a  result for them I think so  take a lot of heart from that because  not only did they win but they tied well  along the way  what a brilliant performance from this  fella well so often we think of these  creative abilities but a couple of goals  here won the match for each team
 it's Portugal way in this match today  against Spain the wonderful thing about  a World Cup it does bring together Alan  countries that have a bit of previous in  terms of form and history and indeed  rivalry and we've got that kind of  situation here yet when I saw this one  it always was marked out as maybe  something special I think the referee  he's gonna have to be on his toes he's  gonna have to have eyes in the back of  his head and times    and now it's time for the national  anthems          Portugal have had a deserved reputation  for decades producing young talented  players obviously Cristiano Ronaldo has  hugged the headlines in recent times but  he's not alone and they're tacitly very  astute as well Alan yeah and this  manager he certainly knows what he wants  from these Flyers tactically he usually  gets he driver    looking at the lineup and got all the  components in place hasn't either  manager for the pressing style of play  has been a feature of his team yet and  many of opponents has found it difficult  to cope with  if you touch isn't spot-on against this  aggressive type of closing down you're  going to lose it in dangerous areas  look at the line up to space with the  higher starts in gold PK starts with  Sergio Ramos as the center backs  Iniesta plays with Thiago in central  midfield Diego Costa is the lone striker  today    our great interest in this particular  group which is now underway the referee  has signaled  Jordi Alba  looking good this move  in Cisco put in from the wide area      shop movements  East oh good block it's defective behind  it will be a corner    let's put in the corner defended well  i J silver  plenty of room on the wing for Ronaldo    that Bay  William Cavalia  and Ronaldo  that's good movement forward here  William Carvalho it's a fast time here  they deserve that goal they'd be the  better team earlier    couldn't miss from there where the  keeper had no chance  let's say the replay now    real pleasure for Portugal they've got  this lead Sergio Busquets  it's got some potential in this move  Sayaka  shop gets blocked  very good indeed but the move is broken  down    now I've got at it  at 10 Silva  advair silver  he's coming forward with some danger  tomato and that's broken up by the  defender before the trust could come in  this could be dangerous in a wide  position Diego Costa and now any ester  supporting player alongside Diego Custer  Tiago  Alaba got a chance to cross  Thiago Busch gets  Rafael Carrera  the technique to deal with the press    I would guess in this possession player  here they're trying to get the  opposition to come out  maybe been passed their way through them  could be dangerous  now why they were in a good position  until that defender did very promptly  and decisively  kind of a house  Sylva    now Jamari  but school want to attack now  typical of grittier ronaldo well it  looks a bad mess picked the defender she  put him off yeah he's going to take a  lot of credit for that because he had to  take the shot quickly the lad who was  trying to score and her silver trying to  switch on the attacking power in this  situation coming up now a corner the  ball just deflected behind for that  when I swung head  shots on here those scraps for the  attack has to feed up from the  goalkeeper that time  well  about how Diego Costa it's a good attack  is by spray  tomato  it is    Thiago - any esta    penalty put away    to see who's going to score some  confident  again    away we go at one or    Cristiano Ronaldo Andrew Silva  now here's a chance to get out the  opposition  but out of silver  couldn't make a chance with this Taco  John's taken go there in front  goalkeeper is annoyed with himself  because he did get a piece of it not  quite enough but the heart wasn't it  well struck the to Facebook    the shock for Spain  we're hearing there will be three added  minutes here  that's good movement forward here        the value that is half-time and we've  reached it at 2 1    so runned away the second half of this  group stage match in Russia and Spain  are behind do thinking spanked continued  knocking the ball about as they did they  will create chances and score  where he's had a go praise the tryna  shot Alan those teammates aren't too  happy    John Lentini Oh  and they've copied out Thiago    I like to look at this attack    simple say poor David Dahiya  quick-witted his movement to to  intercept the good strong tackle  no view Allen Smith on Cristiano  Ronaldo's first half  what a good time to score that was  inside in the lead  within Cavalia    right down the wing keeping the wide  attack going  from leukemia shut up John Lentini oh he  must have thought he'd scored from that  distance keeper had other ideas found  some great protective work has made this  a holding midfield player today been  rewarded really I guess you could say by  getting a bit of a breather with the  substitution now it was always a key  area this because he was up against a  clever number 10 but he had the measure  of him he came out on top Chau 13 yo  for a corner    he's put in the corner lossless joke  even made the save but he couldn't hold  it  would have been a good pass but it  struck the rest    Iniesta  Diego Costa  - good cross good defensive clearance  there  Thiago simple save for Patricio    to cut out the pass      puppet Aquabat  with Danilo address over    I feel like this referees planning  advantage all the time and he's given  Portugal one now has shown him the  inside and he's taken that opportunity  and here's the shot jamario Cristiano  Ronaldo is a chance goalkeeper exposed  Tiago really working hard to be the  controlling influence of this team  it almost here his body's very ticking  over down there    here's a chance to get out the  opposition  Diego Costa  Tiago put the caper    on their toes and to keep this lead  my lats proper defending they can't  score from there it's out of play I gave  it straight to it didn't    penny loafer era    and now any esta Thiago Silva the  fastest marker  really away it's not far away at all  well if I keep creating chances I'm sure  they'll take one that was a decent  effort you know    fantastic game this and it's going to go  right down to the wire  Jamari here's a chance to attack  dr. tackle in  possession with Portugal now flip past  this man now these are charts  think it was and in the end not a  difficult one because there was a couple  yards in it I think Tiago    some sharp movements    we're down to the last five minutes now  the margin is still just one goal and  now Bernardo Silva really getting at the  opposition this far up the pitch now    now olive a defensive tackle  Tiago  Diego Costa stance rode by Diego Costa  east go east Oh    the deep blacks good side    well worth analyzing again    extraordinary game here two very well  matched teams and their trading goal for  goal in the game    Portugal attacking now now jamario how  though  ultimate emia shut up that's a good  block gone behind for a corner and this  could yet be a decisive moment so later  good header back into the danger area  finish level if the referee blows the  whistle for the last time really bad  weather today really good game yeah we  forgot about the weather only ten  minutes in because it was so  entertaining great stuff if you want  more FIFA World Cup action then check  out the site we managed to put together  in our Ultimate Team draft    
 don't  yes  hi there everybody martin tyler here  along with alan smith and our match  today comes from the premier league  the city of manchester we've got  manchester city against manchester  united but the whole area is infected  with football enthusiasm and now  manchester city can take on manchester  united really head-to-head yeah can't  they just the noisy neighbors are here  to stay i think and this one should be  close    everything seemingly on the up at  manchester city choice of  managers the development of the stadium  very good academy for young players as  well very bright on their side of  manchester yeah i think they're doing it  the right way improving that  infrastructure it's been sound  management from the top  getting bigger and better i'm sure  almost every time we come to it the  etihad stadium and new tier opened  relatively recently to increase the  capacity in manchester city enjoying  that kind of success that will bring  even newer fans to their home yeah  they've shared some great memories here  a couple of title wins some man city  fans might still pine for the days of  main road but we're right in the 21st  century with this place  referee is neil swordrick  manchester city has started this first  half    got on the ball in midfield well read by  the player in that part of the pitch  well he's got support here  fernandinho    matic    mata    and here's the shot he's kept it out  and that will be a corner for united  silva  nemanja matic  silver  and here comes an attack from manchester    got his shot off united  manchester united have made it count  they score  and here is another angle on that goal    and that has opened the scoring one nil  here    moving the opposition around with their  play these two players    cut out the pass  intercepting if you like and now can go  on the attack maybe  nemanja matic  so now a goal kick to come  that's a fine goal we can see it again  here no it was a really good one and got  the crowd on the feet    kyle walker  nemanja matic    kyle walker    nemanja matic  romelu lukaku    tremendous understanding from these  players  there goes the cross and he claims the  cross it was well nothing's ever  straightforward for goalkeepers but he's  not been challenged    so we'll restart with a throw-in    trying to stretch the opposition using  the wider areas here that is a cheap  piece of play to give the ball away like  that  here's walker    kevin de bruyne  manchester united have won the ball back  here  romelu lukaku  silva    romelu lukaku    that was a very well timed tackle shot  great work by the goalkeeper the ball is  his he's made sure he's protected it    kyle walker  kevin de bruyne    oh well done the goalkeeper and he's  hung on to the ball  well the referee is signaled for half  time and it's one nil here so the first  half has come to a close with some  decent football being played  them    do  uh  activity on the bench for the losing  team a substitute getting ready to come  on  manchester united with the second half  now underway and they are leading  he's played that nicely with a a dink up  field  pogba  and now the shot he's just reached hit  the goalkeeper  manchester united have won a corner    matic  and now i throw it    here's the cross  they put that cross far too close to the  goalkeeper  well you can see what he was trying to  do but the pass wasn't on it was a bad  ball as it turned out    it's a good place to win the ball here    that's a useful ball in  the shot  terrific stop    turret  vincent company  nicholas otamendi    now they've got the ball back what can  they do from here  silva  walker    moved around nicely here with this  passing game    matic    valencia    mata    it's a super goal from a splendid team  it's men against boys out there and the  opposition goalkeeper can feel exposed  and let down by his defenders  well that's a great goal he showed a lot  of composure not to mention skill to  find the bottom corner like that  just widen the margin here to two-nil    nicholas otamendi short passes but  they're keeping the ball  it's a decent cross  defender blocks the cross  and shoots very close off the top of the  bar    manchester united are going to make a  substitution here    he's read that well in midfield to get  them on the ball  that is a tackle and a half  now fernandinho      and it's going to be his throw here  fernandinho    counting down towards the end of the 90  minutes nine minutes left  manchester united want to make a change  now    nice bit of footwork from the attacker    very good stop here and he scores with  the header  superb goal here now the keeper's a  little disgusting with these defenders  because they just haven't come to his  aid there after a good save  i have to say it's so one-sided today  but all credit to the team  they're racking up the goals    it's with toure    nicholas otamendi  mata  valencia    it's a pretty comprehensive win here as  the referee  calls time up and the final score is  three-nil  well they're going to really remember  this for a long time the winners in a  derby because of the margin it's almost  historic it isn't humiliating for the  losing side here makes it worse so much  worse that it's the derby match and  they're going to take some time to live  this one don't  you
   you                coming up for you on EA Sports a beeper  presentation on Nintendo switch I'm  Martin Tyler  along with Alan Smith I just wonder as  we look ahead to another North London  derby whether Tottenham are concentrated  too much I'm trying to catch up with us  and just play the season as it is and if  they finish it I've asked the world  great that's happened because they've  had a good season well that's right we  often talk about a shift in toe what we  see might be a shift in power at the  start of the season but hasn't quite  happened yet has it  well much of the 1617 season  surrounded for Arsenal in the debate  about the future of arson Bangura then  defined his critics by winning the FA  Cup yes and a fine performance it was at  Wembley that day the fans will want to  see them kick on from that when I'll  still moved here they put up the dates  of the club's successes around the  stadium but for a while there was  nothing that it actually happened since  the Emirates have been the home ground  but of course in 2014 and 2015 they won  the FA Cup on both occasions and they'll  be hoping that opens the floodgates in  that respect I think that's what this  ground is missing history    on a travel attire to find space in the  box there  young talents around Germany's measure  özil such an elusive little customer  wonderful ability to pop up in the box  another angle on it here  and that has opened the scoring one  there's good progress with this attack    that's taken the heat out of the  situation for the moment with that  interception    I'm given the throat that's fine go I  want to see it again I bet you do too  well yeah I think he will want to see it  again as well tonight great finish  don't cuss yell mate    trying to find Alexis Sanchez great work  by the goalkeeper the ball is his these  made sure he's protected it    first get the referees advantage Mousa  dembélé    in front of go club right sister  but ask them the keepers pulled up and  really good save but that's when he  needs the help of these defenders    analyzing again  restarting at tuna    cane  Aaron Ramsey  I've got the ball in the middle of the  pitch here  the tackle there is successfully done  granny checkered  Ramsey  well you can see what he was trying to  do but the past wasn't on it was a bad  ball as it turned out    and he fused his head there to keep  aside in possession they've linked up  well he shut off a decent effort just  just off target yeah unlucky because it  got some power beyond the ball just not  the direction  I'm Annie Chaka  back again  Mousa dembélé Sanchez  Aaron Ramsey  excellent way to lose mocha    Mousa dembélé    song    really trying to use the full width of  the pitch here to make some progress  Christian Eriksen that's the way to win  the ball back    banana checker  sachit    proper clearance well away from the  danger zone well that's a good block  that's an easy interception because the  past wasn't really a very thoughtful one  casi la that's a fine tackle Mesut özil    that's a good challenge between the two  of them there Mousa dembélé    Alex oxlade-chamberlain  Aaron Ramsey    can hit it here  you might be needed again he didn't hang  on to the ball    come on ichika    shut up fine save he's made there and  he's not let the ball escape his grasp    Alexis Sanchez    sachit goalkeeper hangs up  that is a cheap piece of player to give  the ball away like that  and the tackler has been very successful  there he's got possession    okay  the referee is blown for halftime its to  nil here after all the talk the players  are trying to walk the walk and it's  been difficult as you would expect in a  derby at the moment one team a little  happier than the other and you can feel  the tension within the stadium but in  the crowd understand so here we go for  the second half  Aaron Ramsey  safely away  oh sorry cold  that's a good call yeah I think it was  and in the end not a difficult one  because there was a couple yards in it I  think  like I said  whereas a clever little clip into a  teammate read it well    like I said he's gone in strongly and  got the ball referee sees that as a foul  and it is a free-kick  like a set  opportunityto Gazette terrific stop    it's a corner for  here    strong powerful clearance and our store  have possession they've wallet    came  well you can see what he was trying to  do but the past wasn't on it was a bad  ball as it turned out  taught them who are going to make the  change    Oh cake to come  for the losing team  getting ready to come on  so Victor worried Yama  granny Chaka  Sanchez  the referees giving it    and from the Spurs sidelines a  substitute is going to come on well  that's very good positional play and  he's read the situation perfectly  without interception  like a set    here's the chance out confrontive go    song    help ease the pressure  Sanchez    if you look at the coaching manual you  don't defense gonna try to fight save      to make a change and being behind you  can understand that    and it's a headed effort ago      I'll be all the wider    davus  terrific jackal  there's L crossing good stop by the  goalkeeper    guided on by his head and they've got  the ball still    right on the shoulder of the last  defender he's just got to get it right  it's all about timing  I still have the ball again like as it    Mesut özil  crushes in tight margins it just put too  much on it it's over the bar    able to make a good interception  well we've had some chances how long but  it's awhile since we've had a goal  they've still got the lead yeah and  they're knocking the ball about we're  gonna pay a bit of confidence and they  look pretty secure with this lead at the  moment that could soon change though of  course  to get goals haven't I  the manager thinks is to get another  attacker or foul called against Arsenal  Christian Eriksen came right down the  wing keeping the wide attack going    well this pulled up there that could be  a pulled muscle  go kick here      with the way his team have played so far  but he's going to make a substitution  here just to hope that he can retain  this league    we're down now to the final two minutes  of the 90 and he's moved in trying to  jostle the opponent of his stride    like a set  Theo Walcott we're hearing there will be  300 minutes here Theo Walcott  Alex oxlade-chamberlain  Coran ichika  davus  well he's wonderful well forward here    site  this could be what they call the  insurance goal couldn't it to make sure  of the victory to turn a one-goal lead  into two and that no time for recovery  really if they were to get the goal we  could clear it here    so I'll have wallet  bragging around the town now  this victory over the  neighbors go out shopping now rather  than the losers it will be highlighted  at home and it for the next three days          you
 she'll have a fine game for you today  welcome to it hit Tyler here along with  Allen Smith  well we don't need to build this one up  too much after two it speaks for itself  Barcelona and Real Madrid yeah one of  the clashes in world football isn't it  so many stars on both sides can't wait  for this one and it's Barcelona we're  watching today to the players because  they  this season is still a long way to go  but we all expected them to be champions  by looking like that in these early  stages up here  girl  tiffy is the centre-backs and he s the  players with Ibaraki dish in midfield  Lionel Messi is the main striker today      is casimiro  Messimer  mezibov to challenge toni kroos wit  Benzema well-renowned are the target in  the middle that's easily dealt with by  tests taken  it's real madrid looking for a win but  knowing that they've got to be on their  toes today this looks dangerous for  Messi  we swatters    the clocks here  given themselves a terrific boost for  what lies ahead    sometimes as any Fantine you need a  better look for the big getting down he  fell at the feet of the man on the spot  the score  angle on it here      in Barcelona with the lane moderate nice  return pass moving forward with some  danger to the opposition now they're  here  promising build up until that challenge  I've lost the ball and the camp attack  could be there Messi now in full cry    he's frustrated because he is caught  offside maybe he made his run a bit too  soon he's having a little go at his  teammates he did what napped us earlier  is Casa Mira  luis suarez  trying to switch on me they gotta go  Bessie that's about the best you can say  I'm nowhere near he was a long way out  yeah I think that's a waste to try his  luck from that  now Pasadena  there's a dangerous feel to this attack  it's looking good from their point of  view and the goalkeeper can take charge  now    here's the shop  he wasn't fazed by  well he's those defenders outta jail  there because that by the goalkeeper  takes charge here's on the court    Rodrik  BAM  nice bit of interplay between these two  some potential in this move      Benzema    oh no we're did no it's miss cute that  one miss QT paddling and here it is  again  Dale affairs go  raphaël Varane  gross  Tony throws  on the attack hit  what we get to see of course the  assistants don't whether that will  change down the years I'm not sure but  anyway the replay here shows he's got it  right he has there was no real gold  scoring chance but the defensively  pleased that their organization caught  him up could be a chance here they've  got the ball into a good area  data fair  from the cross supported there as he  shot Tom here    toughy doubt  moderate  well there is cover if he loses the ball  well he won't want to do that here  that's the referee decision to added  minutes  to be true  they pulled it back double    it's got everything this locker  Cristiano Ronaldo of goalscoring is the  hardest thing in the game and he does it  he makes it look easy as he has done  again here he's a poacher extreme a goal  scorer superb that was so away we go at  one or  while the referee is in blood for  halftime at wat Wat      but it's time now for the start of the  second half  marcella now they're looking for room in  a wide position pk  raphaël Varane  moderate  now here's a chance  here's a chance to attack good defending    what rich partridge  Karim Benzema    maybe intercept it looking good this  move  even rocket ish  we swatters  modrich gave it straight to him didn't  know sergio busquets      nothing  you see just off  we're gonna see a change shapes around  Madrid    and the attacking now coming from  Barcelona lost the ball that support  touch  headed towards where a teammate can  gather the pool    even rocketing Modric  on to Ronaldo    Sergio Busquets  into the attacking third probing with  the pass Merlin goalkeeper dismissed  Luis Suarez on target again yeah the  pass perfectly timed and so was the run  that's a very good goal and  much-deserved way  like yeah  shut up  modrich just lent the ball to its mates  and got it back again karlova how this  could lead to a chance it's good  attacking play    that's good support as they build this  attack  all about picking the right bass now as  he cuts it back  it's all about positioning and spreading  his body top class people  well time is ticking away it's time for  a change in here it comes    shut up the goalkeeper has done well to  stop that one    that can't be quick on the break now  I see always true    that's great defending they're stopping  that attack and Ronaldo is Isco while  it's an important area to win back the  ball up any ester good forward play from  them they know Messi into the middle  from Messi  good defensive clearance there it Cisco    well this is fascinating and the crowd  are loving the the drama that we're  watching here just a one-goal in it in  favor of the home team here careful that  the milk starts salivating too quickly  and that the players feel they've won  the game before they actually have  very good at date that the movie was  broken down  fail fail trying to ball in behind just  to keep the debate Shirley    stared through Bessie's head now they've  got a chance to say well done the chance  really should have scored well he had  the chance to get his shots away even  though he had to take it quickly sure  job better  two more minutes to be played that added  time    the out-of-time still safe and so  they're running out of opportunities  shut off now I've been coming this  equalizer but it's taken them some time  are we gonna see a winner here I think  we might    and the goal looks spectacular and is  very important  yeah there was some power behind that  effort in the crossbar still shaking but  here's the goal again  well I wonder where we go from here now  that we're level again in the game  anything could happen  and the referees brought a regulation  time to a close with the team still  level      almost a ten out of ten  certainly a candidate for  man-of-the-match he's not going to play  the whole match though and to be  substituted here now yeah he was  involved in most things that were good  here threes team top class that's it  many people on this planet that can do  what he's just done  he's tucked it away well out of the  goalkeepers reach and I love to see that  don't have to whack it from that kind of  position beside footy home    good position here here's the shot to  get the equalizer trying to get in  behind just a little too eagerly then he  could give the defender a yard you know  and still get there well there's nothing  wrong with a pass if you could have just  stayed on side he was through    some potential in this move that's it  they say it's another go  he's doubled up here with his second  goal and he took it in excellent style  just like the first one      I looked at this attack but now any  Esther  Leonel messy cellar    even rocket H free-kick conceded by him    at Cisco  Hale  , how it's no-go  sylia away move  by the assistant    onto the attack now they're really  working the opposition around with this  passing they can't get near it another  car I happened to do a lot of chasing  they're just wearing them out  I won the ball in his own penalty area  going to deal with it now or what a  contest in the first period of extra  time second period to come    and it's down to the last 15 minutes now  as we go into the second half of extra  time Marcela  they could post some danger now  could have half the deficit there that's  when you need your foot man to be nice  and composed and to be clinical and he  just wasn't napkin closing Sergio  Roberto the master of getting into  positions one can receive the ball as  NES there which just opens up his body  to lay it off and they're covered out    Sergio Busquets  all right  unable to cut out the pass    but rich    Benzema Marcela coming on strong looking  to play their way through now well it  looks a bad mess picked the defender yes  put him off yeah he's got to take a lot  of credit for that because he had to  take the shot quickly the landings  trying to score  Avon racket ish  late into passing from Barcelona heywho  find savings made there and he's not let  the ball escape his grasp he has chosen  to add on two extra minutes  taken up by Benzema Benzema  on the gold trailer cat  it has all fallen apart for them in  extra time but they've got this goal  here a last mark in a game that now is  gone beyond them yes to keeping plugging  away that could've easily just sat back  but they haven't they're kept on going  but yeah a little too little too late of  him well the defending hasn't been too  good you have to say that it's finished  now with the final whistle  as a fine performance they work really  well when they had the ball which wasn't  that often but also they were very good  when the opposition had the ball it just  goes to show those possession stats big  ECB it's what you do with a ball and  they used    
 II a sports to the game        that's death death death death death  death death    you  hi there I'm Martin Tyler with me today  as always Alan Smith Thank You Martin  looking forward to this one should be a  good game today's game manchester united  against barcelona  still very much the benchmark Barcelona  rather for the style of football and  little tweaks here and there but very  much it a standard that these players  have to rise to yes I think that's fair  tiki-taka he's known the short style  passing game amended it to a certain  extent I think you've got to do that  against certain sides manchester United  have designed Old Trafford these days  very much for the supporter particularly  those who have certainly come occasion  particularly for those who come in the  week when there aren't matches they have  a wonderful tourist trail around it and  on the pitch it must be an amazing place  to play you can say that again they do  call it the theater of dreams for a  reason so much has been won on this  pitch by the home team and the away one  dma santoso is the ref    Manchester United getting the first half  underway    and the cross is in  those straps when they attack has to  feed on from the goalkeeper that time  hang on to the ball well  Iniesta here's a chance to move forward  from midfield after that interception  even rocket hitch  they might open them up now  we feel good about that a really strong  clean tackle  good position that's what a well read by  the goalkeeper they do hate being  chipped keepers don't they they do it  too and he did anticipate it and  collected it comfortably in the end the  man you automatic  the short-term water fine save and at a  corner for Manchester United    Challenge for the cross  that should be felt it is  oh what a mess oh the pressure has got  to him big time    piqué  nearly Suarez    that's a good challenge  wonderful say  to really reach out for that    that will end the threat at least for  the moment he's moved in trying to just  on the opponent of his stride  mas good support as they build this  attack  they're grateful for that to have an  intervention like that and get back on  the ball when they're defending so much  and now NES do  papa  that's very good positional play and  he's read the situation perfectly with  that interception cutoff say  driving goalkeeper and that will be a  corner for United  free kick hat    it's what you do when you get the ball  that really counts and they're trying to  make the most of that turnover in play  and now any ESCA  he's looking for the cross    that's a corner barcelona's cool    and he lost it in the earlier challenge  and now he's pitched the ball back Todd  back  but now they've won the ball back in the  middle of the park by intercepting that  pass  on the attack here  look  defender has dispossessed it  Barcelona have yet to really make an  impact on the game or no shots at all so  far for Barcelona you have to wonder are  we going to see a shot here before the  game is out the fans are absolutely  furious  that blocked it well for a for  Manchester United  that's the way to win the ball back and  now any Esther pogba matter  United Corner    that is textbook grab him well they've  got power they've got Heights and when  the corn is that accurate only one end  result let's see the replay now  in front here at Manchester United    the value of mattock  the challenge he made the block  even rocket hitch    shut up great stop    oh they look promising there in that  wide area the defenders done well    even rocket hitch Papa Murphy's chosen  to add on two extra minutes  retain for the kpop  help ease the pressure    so it's one nil here as the half-time  whistle goes it's at the start of the  game you've suggested a scenario a  halftime like the one we've got they'd  be delighted wouldn't they I think so I  mean the way they pass the ball about  you and with the team trailing you can  understand why he's going to make it    saw that parts coming in midfield made  the intervention and now maybe he can  push the team forward with his work on  the ball quick head up found a teammate    luis suarez    well they're in a good position here the  magnetic  Romelu Lukaku excellent way to lose  market    and he's put it in to the gold  top-quality no doubt about it that's all  about anticipation and just snuffing up  the rebound different angle on it here  restarting at tuna    stay on its feet  very good tackle  Leonel messy  at that bench Barcelona what to make a  change now  the man you have Matich Romelu Lukaku  they've got it away from the danger  keeps it going  just on target yeah unlucky because it  got some power beyond the ball just not  the direction activity on the bench for  the losing team a substitute getting  ready to come on TT  nice return pass luis suarez  must like to get the throw    mata  played down the wing keeping the wide  attack going lost his man  take the chance with the shot they're  here thought you might have done better  that had a bit of time in space good  position  even rocket ish  Romelu Lukaku the money at matok that's  a good challenge  that Torah    now he's looking for support  let's crust it well he's got it away and  that's what you have to do  add that Torah moving the opposition  around with their play these two players  ha  well they're back defending and they've  cut the pass out there and maybe that  will ease the pressure samuel MTT  Jordi Alba  looking a little messy good place to win  the ball back there because the pressure  was starting to mount and the  interception was timely to say the least  Jordi Alba  can't keep the ball at the moment  he's got a crust to make that  interception he saw it coming  Antonio Valencia even racket each  here's the shot and the goalkeeper got a  touch to that pine saved    Jordi Alba  said you're a better Barcelona I've got  a chance here let's go    there's new hope they cut it back to  what I thought this game was done and  dusted but anything but now or it's a  great finish to take the keeper at the  equation I mean the keeper no chance  there bottom corner that's United's  free-kick    it's noticeable that the home supporters  trying to help their team in this  situation airing what could be  might have just had a big influence on  the game but they've dealt with it and  they can breathe again    Romelu Lukaku we shut off useful block  in those circumstances and it's going to  be his tro here well that's another  there's another angle coming up here  Alan  wonderful contact on the ball there  shots on here will  see the wince on his face maybe the  muscles gone and they've got their new  man ready Barcelona to make the change  in midfield they've got it backfire an  interception  Romelu Lukaku matter  good width in the attack here looking  for a cross at the end of it  okay well well well we've given a  penalty it's a yellow card Alan I think  that's fair enough  from the ref it was it was a clear foul  and it's a clear penalty coming into the  match is ba ba ma Sharada maskatron Oh  Claire's here  the referee calls a halt  it's finished ready now to go into  competitive action again you would feel  having won this friendly  yeah they look just about ready to me  they look fit and they have settled into  a system that they look comfortable with      
 although this is Derrick ray join for commentary&nbsp; by Lee Dixon it's the Champions League knockout&nbsp;&nbsp; stages in a game we've been really looking&nbsp; forward to Barcelona against Juventus in&nbsp;&nbsp; front of just under a hundred thousand two&nbsp; sides who faced each other in the 2015 final&nbsp;&nbsp; with Barcelona prevailing plea this should&nbsp; be sizzling well arguably the biggest team&nbsp;&nbsp; in Spain versus the biggest team in Italy&nbsp; and two of my favorite shirt swaps I have&nbsp;&nbsp; to say played against both these sides&nbsp; over the years prior to possession in&nbsp;&nbsp; my shirt collection well they're happy&nbsp; to have your shirt as well yeah right think back to a memorable semi-finals&nbsp; involving Barcelona the one that comes&nbsp;&nbsp; to mind from Ely 2009 against Chelsea what&nbsp; an epic that was dive was an epic you can&nbsp;&nbsp; look back at club semi-finals and remember him&nbsp; pretty easily but once you said we Barcelona&nbsp;&nbsp; have been so many from Real Madrid as well&nbsp; but I think they'll going to go all the way&nbsp;&nbsp; this year I think they'll be in the final&nbsp; and they could well lift that trophy drugs what we think for Barcelona mark and&nbsp; racist against onsen goal PK stars&nbsp;&nbsp; alongside Sam William TC in the middle&nbsp; of the defense 14-year plays were sent&nbsp;&nbsp; to your Bush gets in central midfield and&nbsp; Luis Suarez will be the main striker here the starting lineup for Aventis&nbsp; boy checks Jen's knee starts in&nbsp;&nbsp; goal and leading the line today is Mario Mandzukic and underway now in this Champions&nbsp; League semi-final first leg Coutinho Suarez yes and it's with titania the basis of&nbsp; that effort one clearly he's not wearing his&nbsp;&nbsp; shooting boots at the moment well strong effort&nbsp; used his laces but screw D well off target it is to be a throwing Missy throw-ins Gibbon Barcelona always fully expect to be at the&nbsp; business end of the UEFA Champions League&nbsp;&nbsp; that doesn't mean that the group stage games&nbsp; don't have their own magically no they don't&nbsp;&nbsp; and every time this team tastes to the pitch&nbsp; there's something special normally happens&nbsp;&nbsp; whether it's an individual or a team effort&nbsp; they really are a special Spanish club well&nbsp;&nbsp; as a rule when you're in direct opposition to&nbsp; Mario Mandzukic you are up against Italy well&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah great tami give them the lead and turned&nbsp; onto the woodwork oh it's off the post well there&nbsp;&nbsp; was so so close there to taking the lead but the&nbsp; Woodward's the goalkeepers friend on that occasion Sergio Busquets Jordi Alba Leonel machine good tackle xiaolu can&nbsp; sail Oh yeah macster Mandzukic now Khedira&nbsp;&nbsp; well possession seeded on the ball Luis Suarez Sergio Roberto Suarez and it's ex-amish and a wild wild attempt from&nbsp; long range not one for a highlight reel where's&nbsp;&nbsp; the poor choice he's got other options&nbsp; on why's he shooting from that distance Yonex nap cristiano ronaldo now Khedira a van rocket hits goes from approval Missy to open the scoring and give his team a lift well there we can see Derek from this&nbsp; better angle when you foliot a boys for your foot to make the connection and&nbsp; there you go in the back of there now under way again with Barcelona in the lead&nbsp; now Kadena Avengers have given us away Leonel&nbsp;&nbsp;

they have the lead what have you made&nbsp;&nbsp; of it so far well Barcelona will be&nbsp; happy that stays like this there's&nbsp;&nbsp; still some work to do in the second half&nbsp; though with the clock ticking down before&nbsp;&nbsp;

come and gone here in Catalonia I've always thought luis suarez as a&nbsp; sort of player you just cannot take&nbsp;&nbsp; your eyes off and that's what's happening&nbsp; tonight we well I've got a word for that&nbsp;&nbsp; first half performance spectacular he&nbsp; was absolutely brilliant he's got his&nbsp;&nbsp; two goals let's see what he's got to offer&nbsp; in the second half and underway now in the hope they go in the second half&nbsp; and you bent just behind here&nbsp;&nbsp; Barcelona have been awarded the&nbsp; throwing rageh touch on the ball Jannik now Matt sweetie now Khedira missing goodness he was right on top of the&nbsp; situation to get the ball back for his team now Matt Sweeney he had the sixth&nbsp;

failed to beat the goalkeeper from barely&nbsp;&nbsp; well it's well worth the effort put well off&nbsp; target and the Aventis personnel change here Deanna CH is with man jock itch now not sweetie can he make this move counts regaining&nbsp; possession for his I cleverly and thirty&nbsp;&nbsp; minutes left for play in this match Jordi&nbsp; Alba not much defensive cover there on&nbsp;&nbsp; the flag crossing possibilities not a&nbsp; very complicated catch for the keeper Cristiano Ronaldo the object of the exercise&nbsp; from you ventus is to get it forward that's&nbsp;&nbsp; what they're doing and the cross is&nbsp; very much on a taco Chris and accurate throw-in forthcoming for varsa and now Coutinho Sergi Roberto now bus guess then Billy on the ball effective challenge&nbsp;&nbsp;

hasn't really been a contest but all&nbsp;&nbsp; credit to any side committed to scoring&nbsp; goals like this dibala Matsui D Emily&nbsp;&nbsp; Chan now it's with man jock itch Cristiano&nbsp; Ronaldo is he going to punish them here the&nbsp;&nbsp; short decidedly lacking accuracy well he had&nbsp; other options as well but he chose to shoot they will now make use of the substitutes bench now busquets even dragutin's&nbsp;&nbsp; carrying a genuine threat here will there&nbsp; be a tangible end product that's a corner they decided that now is&nbsp; the time to go to the bench and firing it into the area and clears his lines&nbsp; in CC forget it prepare to take on the shop and a&nbsp;&nbsp; wild wild attempt from long-range not one for&nbsp; his highlight reel where's the poor choices&nbsp;&nbsp; got other options on why is he shooting&nbsp; from that distance substitution time is Emily John Grado is with dibala event just&nbsp;

needle  as well in the past      well we've got an interesting matchup  here at NASA gates Romelu Lukaku Eden  Hazard he's got a great ability on the  ball the kind of ability that defenders  hate to face blue Lukaku he's one of the  stronger players in this league and he  uses that strength to pretty good effect  here's the Chelsea liner Thibaut  Courtois star signal Gary Cahill starts  alongside Terry Lewis in the heart of  defense it and as our starts with Pedro  and the wide positions  Murata is the sole striker today      this is then the Manchester United liner  now with the hair starts in go Eric by E  place was filled Jones in center    Lukaku is the sole striker today    in my lifetime Melanie Club of course  has been rebuilt Manchester United from  the horror of the communicator crash  back in 1958 there's a great credit to  those at that time who got the club  going again and the the legacy that it's  left and the style is expected of this  great club yeah it's a time that nobody  associated with his Football Club will  ever forget Bobby Charlton Harry Greg  Bill thoughts some famous names from  that time    now mickey carry on  good place to win the ball here  Victor Moses  I think build up until that challenge  Valencia  makuu cariann getting forward well as a  team now  he's very confident with the poor his  faith  date that they move is broken down    contact    and other contact  it's on the move all the time and makes  lots of these interceptions  that's good defending  petrol    contact    Victor Moses  let's bring the ball well    looking from the referee just a  free-kick      Victor Moses  under some pressure he's shielded it  well he's better at winning the ball and  using it and Gerlich on Tay but here he  comes    okay we can get the ball here for his  gold kick      now Jones  now Mickey Korean rash with impressive  attack II play here from Manchester  United  depending  rate interception  Lukaku now with Nick at Aria it's still  a chance in there off the goalkeeper  anticipated the direction of the pass  and was able to intervene lovely  incisive pass  contact    Murata  Marcus Alonzo  it's good play until they got that  challenge it talked  the money a Patek    here's a chance to attack  Romelu Lukaku please cut it out well  well read    chelsey have been the closest challenges  in terms of c'mere League trophies one  to Manchester United of course there's  still a long long way behind but they  are the current champions yeah it is  it's a big game and it's getting bigger  and bigger as the years past for me and  trigging contests this as a    could be dangerous that's a serious  situation and on he goes shots on here  scraps for the attack has to feed up  from the goalkeeper that time come out  to the ball well    i'ma keep Ariane  the mammoth mattock  mata    right bye    good for wordplay from them nonsence  defending from him  don't forego  that would have looked great if it had  flown in but in the end it didn't fly  very close at all no he looked a bit  embarrassed after the her effort  frustration for the manager but by the  same token his team are playing well  they might have got a head there but  he'll get another chance    trying to switch on the attack  are in this situation  good challenge Coco Hendrick Makita reah    good work really to repeal intention of  the pass  Chelsea a little bit of a charge now  through midfield  return ball  Pedro  Marcus Alonzo  ha      some potential in this move  Romelu Lukaku i don't know who the lad  saw their passin ball somebody in the  crowd maybe  David Luiz Moura let's to be played then  add in time to mark us along so it's  going to be an attacking move this from  Chelsea as how this time goes for the  cross  this bull  with the intentions of the opposition or  halfway through  for the goal to bring to you  popped up  but perhaps with Aiden hazard Alan as  the halftime whistlers gone we can look  back on that first half he has had quite  the impact that we expected the shadow  of these normal self out there so unlike  him and hasn't had a chance hardly      chelsey to start their second half    contact  Marcus a lobster  Murata  the opposition the problem with their  inter passing looking good this move    they spread it out wide here chance to  get some width into this attack good  defending and he heads it out for a  throw it    Antonio Valencia now Mickey cariann  Lukaku  blade forward a bit of menace in this  attack here's matter at speed charges  for the ball  petrol Victor Moses  the Chelsea system gets players forward  in the wide areas it's working well for  them    the money of mattock      Macario on this attack a menace to it  Valencia crossing    the first family to go    follow shots in that you    to lose it release it yours but too much  situation now and he's not happy  Manchester United in the late    okay Hill    getting forward well as a team now  Pedro good challenge  down at the hair  nobody advantage    McKey Korea  mata  go in here  you'll see making a change now    Eric by papa  really getting at the opposition this  far up the pitch now please cut that out  well well-read  Pipo Courtois or the back pass    plate down the wig keeping the wide  attack going  contact  and other contact it's a combination of  skill and will    I can't keep it on the pitch he's going  to add fourth Rhodes    they've got to try and  the substitution  Phil Jones  and Ricky terrier    Chelsea a little bit of a charge now  through midfield  the mathematics    now William lovely incisive pass    pull it back here to set up a chance  now Antony Marcial try and get the ball  back now we've got his tackle in the  pools gone out now the man yet mattock  Gbagbo  Valencia now he's looking for support  marvellous tackle  his own talent here to keep the ball and  he has got some bow as a simple to see  they're still leading they've decided to  go for a fresh player in the hope of  hanging on to that lead      here's Mota  now by trying to switch on the attacking  power in this situation  stop by the goalkeeper    that's very good shielding of the ball    he's aimed for the far post here very  easy for the goalkeeper there  mata  now with Lukaku papa  Hendrik Beckett area  Flint now they talk about football being  a passing game and you can keep it very  straightforward piece of goal keeping as  he catches the cross  now by  it's daily blend  good vision was good progress with this  attack    not to the target in the center tries to  punch it away  giving the opposition a problem with  their inter passing there's fàbregas  trying to catch the other team out  guided through    the intentions of the opposition there  to make the interception      the bus yeah    but a space to go forward into with the  ball  hitting hard and love      Manchester United well he's got a chunk  there corner that on his left side he's  so dangerous but once he got his foot to  it  yeah  prediction when it      just widen the margin here to to nil  three minutes from the referee by the  fourth official that's the decision  regarding added time contact now they've  got a chance in this part of the pitch  good  now Mickey tauriel  is the end it's all over      very much on his game today Romelu  Lukaku are lots of energy lots of  quality and a good goal along with  plenty of chances as for the opposition  and he didn't get himself on the score  she she so often does very few  opportunities frustrating game in defeat  for him    Valencia crossing    and I've got the first goal of the game    matter the target in the center tries to  punch it away  space to go forward into with the ball  hitting hard and low    
 hi there everybody martin tyler here  along with alan smith and our match  today comes from the premier league    well it's liverpool against manchester  united if you're of a certain age you'll  remember when liverpool were top dogs in  the 70s and 80s and alex ferguson came  down from scotland to try and change  that and he did manchester united  obviously in the last decade of the last  century the first decade of this century  he got what he wanted but that rivalry  still really exists yeah it doesn't if  you ask the players and particularly the  fans they will say this derby is the one  they look to at the start of every  season  manchester united have certainly  improved defensively and statistically  they have the best defense in the league  it's a wonderful asset to have isn't it  on the road coming to a ground like this  and to know that you really have got a  good defense    when you played here alan did you touch  that anfield sign on the way out or was  that only for the home team that is  strictly only for the home team martin        this is the liverpool side sima minilay  starts in goal nathaniel klein starts  with alberto moreno as the fullbacks  philippe coutinho starts looking to  continue his great form in midfield and  today it's just the one striker in the  side    this is then the manchester united  lineup david de gea starts in goal eric  plays with phil jones in central defence  paul pogba plays with  central midfield romelu lukaku is the  sole striker today    can't talk about liverpool to you  without mentioning anfield in 1989 and  that glorious night for arsenal well  back then nobody tended to win at  anfield i know it's not so easy to  appreciate now but it was a fortress  i'll be hoping to get back to those kind  of times  pogba  mata  guided through by henrikh mkhitaryan  just to keep a debate  and that's dealt with the problem    quick  now this looks promising  and they're keeping the ball that's the  important thing  he's got a chance to cross  antonio valencia  crossed in towards rashford comes out  with a punch to clear the danger  that's a combination of skill and will  to hold off the opposition he can cut it  back now  that's a corner from manchester united    he's put in the corner  well that will mean a corner coming up  now it's a terrific save isn't it from  simon mignolet let's see it again  there's a master at getting his angles  right he's near this goalkeeper  put the corner in the middle      mkhitaryan swung it    he's taking a chance but he's keeping  the ball under some pressure  getting forward well as a team now  good screening and he's kept the ball  right from the kickoff they look like  scoring they have now sharp from the off  and what a good goal  from close range  he took full advantage it's a proper  striker's goal that one he gets just as  much satisfaction out of that as a  20-yarder      liverpool have the lead here    mata  liverpool    petinio  album  cut out the pass    mata lukaku  and he's got the ball away from him with  the tackle  it was a good season 14 15 for  manchester united they did the league  double over liverpool although the game  at old trafford i mean liverpool  actually played really well but they  were beating three nil yeah that was  actually the start of some good months  wasn't it for liverpool and rogers  before it tailed off towards the end of  the season  lukaku off the post        joe matty    jordan henderson  there's a dangerous feel to this attack  it's looking good from their point of  view  i    coutinho  now sadio mani  well read by the defender  henrikh mkhitaryan    on the attack here    well the sprint could be on here for  wynaldo  henrikh mkhitaryan  they tried to keep it but they haven't  been able to do that  nathaniel klein    i think  he can't have scored many better than  this  with the bend he's imparted onto the  ball i'll give him credit you could see  exactly what he set out to do there and  executed it perfectly    well i know this manager has been  working hard on the training ground on a  certain shape and boy is he getting  results out there  just widen the margin here to two-nil  mata    jordan henderson    return pass an advantage for liverpool  can they take advantage of that decision  that's great defending there stopping  that attack  now marcus rashford  henrikh mkhitaryan    mata  could be dangerous  now mkhitaryan  mkhitaryan's target is in the middle  there    nathaniel klein  very good forward thinking from  liverpool always on the front foot    we've got to clear it now promising  build up until that challenge  lukaku  three minutes to be added on  roberto firmino  read the play well to intercept    good  defending  doesn't want to get caught in possession  here    weinaldo  muhammad salla  and it's there for liverpool  well scoring in any game is worthy of  celebration when you get to it is  special  and he is feeling that special delight  at the moment different angle on it here    well this is delightful football from  liverpool today    and the referee has signaled for  halftime  3-0 is the scoreline at this point  only one team in it  as we head for half-time only one team  in it the other team  they are struggling well wildly  different team talks i think from the  managers  one's got an awful lot of work to do the  other one will be saying same again  please lads    crossed in towards rashford    you don't often get a first half as  one-sided as this one they've been very  good the team that are leading of course  that's caught the defenders out it's a  great run and a good pass    lukaku with rashford again  looking to make an opportunity either  for himself for a team mate  quick witted and quick in this movement  too to intercept there    joel mati  moreno henderson  wynelda  nathaniel klein  bit of space to go forward into with the  ball    crisp defending there    rashford  henrikh mkhitaryan  lukaku  he's fouled by diane lovren  yellow here for lovren    rash alan reckless when you attempt to  slide tackle like that you've got to  time it perfectly  manchester united  manchester united want to make a change  now        very good distance to the clearance  jordan henderson    roberto firmino  they've got numbers in this attack and  it looks dangerous    it's a day he'll never forget  what are days having  three goals now he's been a thorn in the  side of the opposition all match and he  thoroughly deserves that hat-trick    well i think this manager was  pessimistic coming into this game and uh  those fears are being realized now his  team trailing by a good margin    i have to say it's so one-sided today  but all credit to the team  they're racking up the goals  trying to switch on the attacking power  in this situation  well we thought we were here for a very  even contest allen but hasn't panned out  that way at all it hasn't i mean you  look at the two sides man for man  there's not much to choose between them  but i think tactically the team lead in  here has been a bit more cute lukaku  wonderful save  had to really reach out for that  substitution now for liverpool    got his head to it well but no power  welter to get there first to find some  space but couldn't apply the finishing  touch  that is a cheap piece of play to give  the ball away like that  i think he saw the look from the other  player and saw where the pass was going  and read it    anticipated the direction of the pass  and was able to intervene  roberto firmino  onto the attack now  into the box it goes along the  ground now mkhitaryan    jordan henderson  he must have some sixth sense to  anticipate when that pass was going they  looked in but he's defused the danger  liverpool are going to make an  alteration to their lineup from the  bench  nathaniel klein  coutinho  coming on strong and looking to play  their way through now  it's delhi blind    now anthony martial  on the defenders    shots on here i'll give him credit for  having a go but he was nowhere near the  target yeah he took responsibility  and he'll be hoping better next time      jones    now anthony martial    it's money  quick passing from liverpool to open up  the opposition if they can  and then he goes with the tackle    valencia that's cut out    sturridge  mata    antonio valencia  and uh herrera  it's delhi blind    well this attack a little bit of menace  to it    still on the attack and they've got a  corner    and then it goes we've got his fist to  it  it looks like being one of those games  where the liverpool keeper is not going  to get beaten trying to get the cross in  nearest defender blocked it    good screening and he's kept the ball  good forward play from them  he points to the spark penalty  penalty given but no extra punishment  for the culprit yeah i think that's fair  enough i mean it was a foul but he's not  denied an obvious goal scoring  opportunity there  well you run the risk when you go to  ground like that with a slide tackle of  getting into serious trouble all right  it's a definite foul martin just a  slight tackle but he just mistimed it  badly  and puts away the penalty    no worry about the pressure or the  responsibility here and there's the goal  yeah i think some people are cut out  some aren't this lad certainly is    four one is the score line    most defenders will be furious with that  because they were seeing the game out  quite comfortably it seemed but a little  bit of loss of concentration they've  lost a goal yeah maybe you can  understand it it's been so uh easy for  them out there that they've taken the  foot off the  gas he's spotting it up now to take the  corner  excellent performance from the team the  supporters know that the job is pretty  much done and they're just loving it i  don't think we'll get them out of the  ground at the end well they've been  treated to some really good football  haven't they some good goals and uh  appreciative of that  very good distance to the clearance  could be dangerous  well it was a foul and he's given the  free kick  ah      ah      this could lead to a chance it's good  attacking play  makes the challenge here  and uh  and that  is the end it's all over  it was absolutely  extraordinary exceptional elegant  excellent  well he goes across and grabs the match  ball from the ref the hat trick and  that's to be treasured by any player      good screening and he's kept the ball  money    i think    not a good challenge by the defender  money  and puts away the penalty      you
 la liga is the competition that we're  featuring in our match today I'm Martin  Tyler  hello to you all Allen Smith is with me  española this match today against  barcelona still very much the benchmark  barcelona  and little tweaks here and there but  pretty much standard that these players  have to rise  yes I think that's fair tiki-taka as it  is no that short style passing game  did it to a certain extent that you've  got to do that against certain sides  the table is for espanol    Barcelona's line up here  just against us to go  of DG players with pre-k and central  defense and he asked the players with  Carly do it  an Italian ambassador is a front with  Luis Suarez        gotta stop out ready to get  under way    Barcelona got the game underway  referee's going to manage this match and  giving this foul I think it's quite a  good thing to do      coming on strong looking to play their  way through now  now Bessie  cutie  did well    Victor Sanchez got the ball and they're  going at the opposition with speed  guiding it through the defendants place  to try and hit it broken through here  with a pretty good goal and these  celebrations reflect that the supporters  are going crazy  it's a terrific moment for the team      finished      so the first goal is what now  PJ  Iniesta  meet into passing from Barcelona John's  on he got in the way    a bit lucky it was deflected    played in by Messi apparently given to  Barcelona    did you see anything cynical in that  hour didn't look comfortable going into  it and it was a definite foul    penalty put away      he's one of the lads who really wanted  to take on this responsibility and it's  show well probably the last man you want  to face from the penalty is Leonor Messi  and you can see why    so away we go at one or  Veneto  this attack  challenges to the ball    now Bessie    great tacky good place to win the ball  here  all right now at Messi Luis Suarez it  was a real opportunity but there might  be a key moment in there from the  defensive point of view yeah well they  really did converge on him quickly he  didn't miss by much but he's missed him    Victor Sanchez    continue  toward here    Paulino patina oh now it's Suarez we  can't put them in front  what a big goal that might turn out to  be    - for him on the day and - very well  taken goals  I want to see this again this goal      tsubasa    a great understanding with their passing  Nusrat is good position they've worked  this attack very well shut up  Suarez he's blocked the shot well I was  corner I had that deflection      gone short with a corner    continue crushing it now put away but  not out of harm's way    only attack hit real corner  their chance to draw level in the match      corner play did    a good position here    coming out now Iniesta  the teen year    messy  get his foot in there  find some space here on the flanks ft  style and here's the shot so close the  post  it's a good game is because Barcelona  aren't having it all their own way  although they do lead    an arrow good screening and these kept  the ball  coming on strong and looking to play  their way through now 14 here    they no mess  excellent work with the tackle    shut up the goalkeeper reached for it he  didn't have to reach a full stretch made  a bit of a meal of it there      they get it away    it's messy  and Barcelona on the attack  okay great save well he shouldn't about  a prayer there but he's so agile these  people      tried to catch the opposition out of the  short corner all right continue with  racket itch  he's coming back looking for a teammate  entre Barcelona :      Thank You Tate  shots on here and they have scored they  do lead now by two and they've worked  very hard for this it should get them  across the line at the end of the match  we'll see    it is certainly they kind of match that  we thought we were coming here to see  with their better team playing the  better football you know they've handled  that expectation have nine terms have  been strong favorites so they apply to  them for that  just to remind a31 it is now the scholar  plotting and the referee blows for half  time the teams go in at 3 1 and what  about  Messi's first half a load on top of this  game out there and I'm sure you'll be  thinking about gravity's hot chick in  the second half    it's the top Tao of the second half  moving forward with some danger to the  opposition now the hair cut out well  well read    striding forward purposefully could get  his cotton now  looking for any esta  fled away by the defender  Iniesta parley Nia they couldn't quite  find Messi    Iniesta back into midfield for the  moment for Messi Suarez with Iniesta  again promising build up until that  challenge empty stout moving the  opposition around with their play at  these two players now here's a chance to  get at the opposition that's passed by  everyone very nearly got on the end of  it that's good defending  we'll be a truck    coming off his Iniesta        they owe Baptist ow he's aimed the end  towards this fist away by the keeper  very good distance to the clearance  little messy    and now Messi they could pose some  danger now looking for Cuttino in the  center    any possession with a header coming on  strong and looking to play their way  through now here's the shot three of the  best he's made them pay and that  completes a wonderful hat-trick    well maybe that's the one he'll treasure  the most because it's given him the hat  trick yep he'll be taking home that much  bull  let's go  over and over again isn't it    I think the managers decided he wants to  that they player have a great individual  reception which he wouldn't get at the  final whistle he's getting an ovation  now as the substitution is made yeah and  well deserved to a strong contender for  Man of the Match I have to say it's so  one-sided today but all credit to the  team they're racking up the goals a  return ball  Leonel Messi  Lopez  Leonore messy plate forward a bit of  menace in this attack  they spread it out wide here chance to  get some width into this attack  sérgio Roberto  that's it  even rocket H  Jordi Alba Sergio Busquets Coutinho and  he gives it back to it Danny Suarez  possession given away once more    luis suarez Danny Suarez well this  attack could have been a menace to it    now still one of the great teams to  watch Barcelona and they're evolving  they have a great supply line of young  players when you think maybe golden  generation they're going to and to be  saved by and greater Stegen    really getting at the opposition this  far up the pitch now it's coming up now  a corner the balls just deflected behind  for that  based on activity from the venture  Barcelona    swung in from the corner    Jordi Alba really trying to use the full  width of the pitch here to make some  progress  watch attached    we'll team effort they understand me  between those lads down there    they haven't switched off Allen late in  the game they've got another one  extended the lead not letting up at all  showing their ruthless psyche fair play  to them here is another angle on that  goal      well we're in the last few minutes now  the die has been cast in this game  really  nothing so far in this game to surprise  us perhaps only the the margin that they  lead by it's not always easy coming into  a game and everyone's expecting you to  get a hat full but they've kept their  focus this side and taken the chances  nicely when they've cropped up  making sure there's no turnover  he's read that has me and made the  interception made it look easy actually  break maybe from Barcelona    it's a good idea with the pass to the  accountant is  well sometimes we talk about the double  whammy if it's a single whammy here it's  just a penalty you had the prior concern  looked a little relieved I think he  thought he was going to see yellow there  I always saved it and he's guessed the  right way and two strong hands to the  ball brilliant now the game has run its  course here and there's the final  whistle  so Leo Messi your verdict talents trip  while he goes across and grabs the match  ball from the left  trick and that's to be treasured by any  player  well they're going to really remember  this for a long time the winners in a  derby because of the margin  it's almost historic it isn't  humiliating for the losing side here  makes it worse so much worse that it's  the derby match and and it takes some  time to live this one down
   and it's Portugal to play in this match  today against Argentina well this is a  matchup between two international teams  today disadvantaged Alan is that they  don't play together very often positive  of course is they are the country's very  best boys they are indeed and we have  got some quality players to enjoy out  there today but as you say no Lola  played together too often so there might  be a slight lack of understanding at  times  number ten              this is the lineup for the hope side  he's going to defend with six isn't he's  going to have those two holding midfield  players and that the other four go and  attack when they can yeah I'm in the two  lads in the middle the two midfielders  are naturally defensive minded players  Martin so I don't think now naturally  get forward to willingly so yeah it  looks fairly cautious lineup this is the  away side Sergio Romero plays in goal  Nicolas autumn ending plays with Javier  Mascherano as the centre backs a verbum  ager plays alongside Lucas billion in  the middle of the park  Mauro Akari is the sole striker today  it's Portugal to kickoff    Costa  every bodega  philia  I see  Bacardi  what a charge for messy    there's some potential in this move  Elysee  support play from his teammates  and now Messi Ava Bennigan's  they know message  philia  philia  an attack from Argentina Federico Fazio  Ava Bennigan's  B Leah still passing I'm not really  making inroads philia messy the Caddy  pulls it back now    go back the Interceptor got it for them  DeMaria  trying to pick out Messi defend it well  a trans Silva  here's Cristiano Ronaldo Portugal  attacking now typical Ronaldo he wants  to take them on  they want to see Christiano and now  they're coming at you like that Mario    the  in front up to grabs here  that's very good shielding of the ball  another silver in with the chaps  lead now it hasn't come easily delighted  with it is a well crafted home try and  finish at the end of it  well he said it up in the back of the  net quite high up to if I'm not sure  when we actually meant it just to go  under the bar maybe we'll find out        real pleasure for Portugal they've got  this lead happy a masculine Oh  billion  Federico Fazio  backing down  far too close  across to the kaepa    edit down to a teammate  philia  Akane trying to slip it through comes  out off the goalkeeper Pepe is clearance  how to play for a TRO  Cedric  but are those silver    I say that here we've got a free-kick  given by the referee    bill yeah  Picaro Acosta clever ball in on the  goalkeeper shot gets blocked  look from the other player and saw where  the past was going and read it  Ava bonaga  played forward a bit of Menace in this  attack  going to go great goalkeeper great save  well he shouldn't about a prayer there  but he's so agile these people  it's a nagger Accardi  it is an equalizer that looked on the  cards I must say as the game went on you  just wonder whether they would get  frustrated but now they're in a position  having equalized to go on and try and  win it  fantastic from the neutral point of view  that the game is level again    good luck here again by the replay of  the goal    so away we go at 1:00 or now a giant  silver so here we are at halftime and  it's one one  a player but we're featuring here has  done well he's certainly been an  influence on this first half well really  good late equalizing goal and that might  just change the managers team talk now    and the kickoff it's Argentina for the  start of the second half  Ava Banega  philia and here's some attacking play  from Argentina  it counted Lucas big  Federico Fazio a threat at the moment  but they have got the ball and that I  suppose is a threat messing it has to be  very quick  Cavalia here's Cristiano Ronaldo  Portugal attacking now not a good  challenge by the defender in a great  position to pull it back      centering  cut that out well well-read    that can be quick on the break now Akari  philia  Ava Banega Messi Bacardi DeMaria  Mona given to Argentina  gonna plate into the middle well they  just got the ball away it's another  corner  let's have another glance at that save  oh that is wonderful stuff    and it's taken  very close in Allen but not very close  to story yeah a simple save in the end  and it should have been anything but he  should have been picking out the dead  the keeper is shall Mario jamario and  the attack coming from Portugal    Renaldo  that'll be a corner  it's gonna be a change for Portugal    Paul has taken disappointed that that  didn't lead to more into the gloves of  the goalkeeper the hardest thing he'll  have to do today by any means    philia    Acosta  trying to switch on the attacking power  in this situation  promising build up until that challenge  is Cristiano Ronaldo  and I've copied out  they know Messi    Lucas biglan  now with messy  shut up well just  sit on a porch go fetch with the  substitutes    it's message corner cleared away by the  defender that's good support as they  build this attack  and the referee is given the free cake  it's Bernardo Silva  now danila  now here's a chance to get at the  opposition team yo with good fishing    hvala in opposition of pressing high up  the pitch but they're keeping the bull  they've got enough numbers back    alongside  that's it    right moment is decisive moment in the  match we feel sure  and here he was faced by the goalkeeper  that was the challenge in you go easy as  you like it looks easy doesn't it but I  can tell you it's not you have to be at  the top of your game to joy and to  convert      well a very exciting climax to an  exciting game this could be the decider  well it could be any stage in an  accident see much of a  be decisive  it's going to be a minimum of three  minutes to be played of added time  excellent play to attack in this late  stage they haven't given up yet  by the whistle  please to win the match I guess because  that's what you do whenever you play but  as a friendly game more than just a  result for them I think so now take a  lot of heart from that because not only  did they win but they played well along  the way so Leo Messi your verdict  talents with when they had a good  performance and snatched that light goal  to grab the win
 hello everyone Martin Tyler here&nbsp; Alan Smith with me as usual welcome&nbsp;&nbsp; to you to today's game the game&nbsp; today Liverpool against Barcelona so much success in this stadium until for&nbsp; Liverpool Football Club in the 70s and 80s&nbsp;&nbsp; it's still regarded as a mecca for many the world&nbsp; yeah I remember visiting it in 1989 that well&nbsp;&nbsp; that was a good night a bit disappointing you&nbsp; haven't mentioned that Martin sure opposition&nbsp;&nbsp; coaches when Messi's on the pitch he is here&nbsp; they will show him onto his right foot doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp; work does it no easier said than done he's a&nbsp; little genius and I'd expect him to take this&nbsp;&nbsp; game by the scruff of the neck can't talk about&nbsp; Liverpool to you without mentioning ham field in&nbsp;&nbsp; 1989 and that glorious night for Arsenal nobody&nbsp; tended to winner and field oh no it's not so easy&nbsp;&nbsp; to appreciate now but it was a fortress I'll&nbsp; be hoping to get back to those kind of times this is the Liverpool side-seam a&nbsp; mini lay starting go John mattock&nbsp;&nbsp; starts with a and love run as the centre&nbsp; backs Savio money starts with Muhammad&nbsp;&nbsp; Salla in the wide positions and just&nbsp; one out in our attacker in the liner Barcelona's lineup here mark and Rita stegun&nbsp; starts in go Samwell on TV plays with Jared PK and&nbsp;&nbsp; central defense Iniesta plays with Yvonne racket&nbsp; in midfield Luis Suarez is the lone striker today Barcelona got the game underway good vision from Suarez&nbsp; Barcelona moving smartly here wine Alden it goes out wide again they have now shot for me off and what a good day that was an amazing shot very&nbsp; difficult technique and the&nbsp;&nbsp; goalkeeper left helpless well he's rooted&nbsp; to the spot he's flew past in at sub pace Liverpool have taken the lady man rocketing luis suarez lovely Roberto Firmino Virginia one album no no Southside Sergio Busquets as a play for a truck Leonel invested luis suarez and Barcelona on the&nbsp; attack promising build up until that challenge Nathaniel Klein now it goes into the wider areas&nbsp; where they've got a winger waiting&nbsp;&nbsp; and now he's looking for&nbsp; some support from the ball Colette his wake aside look at where I&nbsp; did it Martin he took a little chance&nbsp;&nbsp; there and he's been rewarded for&nbsp; let's take another look at the goal oh he's loving it the manager he'd seen his team&nbsp; playing really well just what he was asking for restarting a tuna even rocket each city now sodium on a continuum but he's got the ball down affair Sergio Busquets it's morning they've got numbers in&nbsp; this attack and it looks dangerous why'd they were in a good position until that&nbsp; defender did very promptly and decisively couldn't keep it in play it's gone out for throat TK even rocket ish luis suarez&nbsp; strong challege nathaniel climb Jordan Henderson Verena petunia so we'll shine to Liverpool's play from these&nbsp; kinds of attacks now I'll better Marina now&nbsp;&nbsp; can he take them on through everything behind&nbsp; that shot I'm frustrated that it wasn't quite&nbsp;&nbsp; on target well if he keeps getting in those&nbsp; kind of areas I'm sure he'll score pretty soon Ghirardelli fail meet into passing from Barcelona Jordi Alba Suarez day Lefou and he's in an&nbsp; opportunity there chance is now just a smooth&nbsp;&nbsp; operator via crush and midfield man who likes to&nbsp; get forward and shows the value of it once again well for a fraction of a second Alan&nbsp; I thought he was going to keep it out&nbsp;&nbsp; he did get a touch on the ball the goalkeeper&nbsp; but in it went yeah he's annoyed with himself&nbsp;&nbsp; there he's his own harshest critic and&nbsp; he feels he should have done better if we go again to one Nathanial climb why Naldo good position&nbsp; they've worked is attacked very well into&nbsp;&nbsp; a quite a dangerous position&nbsp; now it's messy Sergio Busquets&nbsp;&nbsp; and now Messi challenges for&nbsp; the ball Jordan Henderson Wein Alda Nathaniel climb still passing not really making in road what a corner the team yo plays the ball in noted&nbsp; back into the middle goal kick to come Sergio Busquets and now any está right maybe from Barcelona oh what a mess well what a chance&nbsp; for an equaliser that was and I&nbsp;&nbsp; think the tension got to him tightened up Anderson Roberto Firmino it's manic darting infield now shuttle great work&nbsp;&nbsp; by the goalkeeper the ball is his&nbsp; these made sure he's protected it Jordi Alba Sergio Busquets Luis Suarez that's now with Liverpool Cuttino vision we said again how close it was to maybe&nbsp; hitting the post and staying out but luck&nbsp;&nbsp; was with him and it goes it counts now I&nbsp; think the goalkeeper thought he got his&nbsp;&nbsp; angles covered there but he didn't look too&nbsp; pleased with it who you bound it in but it's&nbsp;&nbsp; great when a plan comes together and the manager&nbsp; doubly delighted with the way he's team a plane has to remind a31 it is now taller&nbsp; even rackety and now any ester luis&nbsp;&nbsp; suarez it's good play until they&nbsp; got that challenge in petunia that's halftime and three&nbsp; one is the score at the break Cuttino has been outstanding in this&nbsp; first half I'll be happy without first&nbsp;&nbsp; 45 minutes he was a good goal from him&nbsp; good on overall performance actually can Liverpool replicate good first half&nbsp; in the second period which is now underway muhammad salla coming on strong and looking&nbsp; to play their way through now a brilliant&nbsp;&nbsp; goal well he's not far out that you've got to be&nbsp; on your toes in these circumstances and he was he took it with great aplomb I'm&nbsp; sure getting the first goal gave&nbsp;&nbsp; him the confidence to grab the second&nbsp; chance here another angle on it here I have to say it's so one-sided today but all&nbsp; credit to the team they're racking up the goals continue Wein Alda play down the wing keeping the wide&nbsp; attack going they'll need to try and&nbsp;&nbsp; get the ball back now Sergio Busquets&nbsp; even racket itch luis suarez it's messy Joel Matty there's a lot of pre-match talk between the&nbsp; two managers one's got his team absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp; right and as the goals to show for it and&nbsp; the other hasn't no I mean the winning may&nbsp;&nbsp; lead you if he does win will claim&nbsp; attacked or masterclass here I think&nbsp;&nbsp; lines that overcome the opposition I&nbsp; went the flag offside given free kick sérgio betcha Sergio Busquets luis suarez&nbsp; lovely football typical barcelona Henderson Jordan Henderson sweetness bad so better this time from&nbsp; the keeper he's kept going as knees kept&nbsp;&nbsp; his head off and maybe that will be&nbsp; the turn in terms of his format here Jordan Henderson and now any Esther good work really&nbsp; to read the intention of the pass Wein Alda Nathaniel climb Jared&nbsp; Alafaya even rocket each luis&nbsp;&nbsp; suarez well they're in a good position here defender really putting his body&nbsp; on the line to stop the cross it's morning now this is an interesting attack continue Brazilian Filipe academia it's&nbsp; always good an eye for the main chance well he's doubled up here with his second goal&nbsp;&nbsp; and he took it in excellent&nbsp; style just like the first one we can see a slightly different viewpoint on it well I know this manage has been working hard on&nbsp;&nbsp; the training ground on a certain shape&nbsp; and boy is he getting results out there one team really on their game today the other&nbsp; very off color though he swallows even rocket ish muhammad salla there's some potential&nbsp; in this move bikini Oh Roberto Firmino but Liverpool it is looking pretty much&nbsp; now that the victory is a short it's&nbsp;&nbsp; an end of the situation for them should&nbsp; be harmonized and here's the goal again and only we expected this such&nbsp; a one-sided affair but look at&nbsp;&nbsp; the scholar able to cut that out sharp movement Roberto Firmino Nathaniel climb good athlete Jordan Henderson&nbsp; and he's showing it now&nbsp;&nbsp; Jordan Henderson is satyam on a Kamino&nbsp; still a chance in there off the goalkeeper Iniesta Barcelona moving&nbsp; smartly here all right Iniesta Roberto Firmino since it's kept out incredibly by just&nbsp; Aegon but he's bound his teammates had here's messy in his wide areas where he's&nbsp; such a danger Roberto Firmino Jordan Henderson had you said for tenure the better for me know while a corner to come because&nbsp; of that deflections the corner&nbsp;&nbsp; all Peters out rather for them and here's the shot little messy lovely Patino when Alda Roberto Camino&nbsp; the shut up goalkeeper exposed Sergio Busquets well now they've won the ball back&nbsp;&nbsp; in the middle of the park&nbsp; by intercepting that pass his climb makes a challenge here the fishing's in what can&nbsp;&nbsp; be dangerous Pitino's forced loose jockey&nbsp; that made the save but he couldn't hold it luis suarez moving forward with some&nbsp; danger to the opposition now they're here here's the end it's all over we'll look at&nbsp; that score line and it emphasizes what we've&nbsp;&nbsp; seen in the shape of the game as well&nbsp; very one-sided well the first whistle&nbsp;&nbsp; they were on top and it never altered&nbsp; to the entire 90 minutes wonderful stuff&nbsp;&nbsp; what a brilliant performance from this&nbsp; fella so often we think of these creative&nbsp;&nbsp; abilities but a couple of girls here the&nbsp; man to his team well as for the opposition&nbsp;&nbsp; was a frustrating game for him he really&nbsp; couldn't get into it make the sort of impact
 welcome everybody Martin Tyler along with Allen&nbsp; Smith pal I'm looking forward to it today I&nbsp;&nbsp; think so marching there's a really good buzz&nbsp; in the air here the image of Didier Drogba at&nbsp;&nbsp; the final whistle semi-final when NES discovered&nbsp; right at the end will always be my first thoughts&nbsp;&nbsp; for Jesse play Barcelona yeah unforgettable&nbsp; moments we have had some some top-class toys Barcelona's lineup here mark&nbsp; Andre has taken starts and go&nbsp;&nbsp; Samuel MDT plays with Jared PK and&nbsp; central defense he banned racket&nbsp;&nbsp; inch plays with Iniesta in the middle&nbsp; Luis Suarez is the lone striker today it's a real group mentality in this&nbsp; line up about pressing the opposition&nbsp;&nbsp; into making mistakes and cashing in&nbsp; on it straight away well it takes a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of energy a lot of motivation it's&nbsp; easy to drop off and when you do drop&nbsp;&nbsp; off that really aggressive closing&nbsp; down that's when it can fall down well this is the Wembley stadium of today&nbsp; it's been open since 2007 and it's got its&nbsp;&nbsp; own memories and many of the supporters here&nbsp; will not perhaps think about the the former&nbsp;&nbsp; Stadium where you graced of course Allen&nbsp; and many famous occasions where were staged&nbsp;&nbsp; but this is where it's all about now where&nbsp; it's at and it deserves to be here it's a&nbsp;&nbsp; magnificent structure certainly is something&nbsp; I think it's still regarded worldwide as the&nbsp;&nbsp; hold the football and as a football you&nbsp; just want to do yourself justice out there match official today is Luke core bucket Chelsea have started the first half there's a dangerous feel to this attack&nbsp; it's looking good from their point of view&nbsp;&nbsp; and then he goes through the tackle of TT Jordi Alba Sergio Busquets as a they're predictable with the&nbsp; passing and the upward to deal with that bobak Barcelona took me a chance here&nbsp; they've got the ball into a good area gotta shut up now Murata Barcelona always expect to win but&nbsp; they know this won't be easy contact&nbsp;&nbsp; to switch on the attacking power in&nbsp; this situation and here's the shot corner Barcelona put the corner in the middle&nbsp; he's pissed away by the keeper racket äj-- sérgio betcha well this attack I've been a menace to it&nbsp; the short talk that's easy for Courtois sorry coming cut it out good work you&nbsp; really get at your position here what&nbsp;&nbsp; out ah still a chance in there off the goalkeeper chance to go at the opposition with pace&nbsp; taken on by de Lafayette pace Victor Moses&nbsp;&nbsp; must like to get the throw so wasted&nbsp; sorry's good let's try to be opposition Sergio Busquets Iniesta even&nbsp; rocket ish Sergio Roberto good play till they cut that&nbsp; challenge in his content&nbsp;&nbsp; here's an opportunity reach&nbsp; it and rescued his side Murata Sergi Roberto Leonel messy it's&nbsp; messy but here they are only attack&nbsp;&nbsp; headed down to a teammate anticipated the&nbsp; direction of the pass and was able to intervene Murata very good indeed but the move was broken down&nbsp;&nbsp; Jordi Alba Iniesta Sergio Busquets&nbsp; there's good progress with this attack Jordi Alba even rocket ish shut up&nbsp; good stop by the goalkeeper and now Iniesta even racket&nbsp; itch Sergio Roberto they down&nbsp;&nbsp; the wing to the dangerous Messi good&nbsp; challenge hit a return ball Cahill petrol contact Murata tt Jarrid Alafaya racket äj-- Iniesta attacking now&nbsp;&nbsp; shots on here that's a good block they put a&nbsp; corner out of that bit lucky it was deflected in goes the corner only partially&nbsp; clear that's easy for cook and asta looking good this move got brains from dribbling&nbsp; skills daily payout and we're about to see them&nbsp;&nbsp; look evilly no messy nipped in the bud by the&nbsp; raising of the flag from the assistant to me&nbsp;&nbsp; like the timing of the pass and the burn was&nbsp; spot on but closer inspection now he was off all right he's gone what to go what it's&nbsp; not often you see somebody found it back&nbsp;&nbsp; on a net for that distance that is stunning&nbsp; while they defied the odds and taking the&nbsp;&nbsp; shot on let alone scoring the goal was perhaps&nbsp; the place where it was impossible to save it&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh goalkeeper could have reached out the clips&nbsp; the closed underway in yeah really good start&nbsp;&nbsp; he took it early as well and I think that's what&nbsp; caught the goalie off-guard as much as anything tonio Conte not used to losing really secures&nbsp; but is in that situation now and he's not happy good news for Barcelona they lead&nbsp;&nbsp; that's our time signal by the referee one-nil&nbsp; the halftime score thoughts on Luis Suarez in&nbsp;&nbsp; the first half Alan yeah what a good time&nbsp; to score that was a putting side in the lead Wembley Stadium fans sit back in&nbsp; it for the start of the second half even rocket hitch I've got the ball&nbsp; and the middle of the pitch here Busquets now here's a chance to get at the opposition&nbsp; rocket it I want to find goal they lead by two&nbsp;&nbsp; now they'll feel a little bit more comfortable&nbsp; good value for this advantage at the moment&nbsp;&nbsp; to admire the way he placed the ball&nbsp; into the bottom corner of the net for&nbsp;&nbsp; the goalkeepers in the decent position&nbsp; he's helped us to stop that one going in just widen the margin here to to nil&nbsp; davon Lewis on the ball in midfield&nbsp;&nbsp; well read by a player in that part of&nbsp; the pitch even rocket each has good&nbsp;&nbsp; movement forward here it's good play until&nbsp; they got that challenge it down in Lewis in quickly a lonesome okay Hill that's gonna crater Cahill on the attack we're gonna pay credit to the full-back who's&nbsp; been marking the winger because he's given&nbsp;&nbsp; him nothing out has he so it's no surprise&nbsp; that the white man's being substituted here&nbsp;&nbsp; he's got nice and tides all matched they&nbsp; fall back but when that happens you've got&nbsp;&nbsp; tried mix up your game give him something&nbsp; different to think about and they couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; come up with the answer throw to come&nbsp; up now after the balls gone out Murata&nbsp;&nbsp; he saw the look from the other player and&nbsp; saw where the pass was going and read it tacky well here what about this&nbsp; for a shot to Mystic over to you&nbsp;&nbsp; feel this change the scientists behind&nbsp; Richard tactics now to be defenseman&nbsp;&nbsp; that's an easy interception the pass wasn't really&nbsp;&nbsp; nowhere near no is miscued&nbsp; that one and scooty paddling contact another contact say to you Roberto&nbsp; could be dangerous tried his luck nowhere&nbsp;&nbsp; near it was a long way out yeah I think&nbsp; that's a waste to try his luck from there here's Willie Marcus Alonso could whip it in now easy for&nbsp; the goalkeeper when really it was every chance&nbsp;&nbsp; of him being totally beaten then he's got&nbsp; the ball yeah he was exposed there and he&nbsp;&nbsp; must have thought he was going to get beaten&nbsp; but well the lad just made a real hash of it&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't he just a case of finding the spare&nbsp; man as what was available in their own half&nbsp;&nbsp; and the opposition letting them do this&nbsp; at the moment although they are trailing because he's certainly going to be within their&nbsp; rage now that the free-kick has been given so here comes the free kick well he has gone&nbsp; for goal but you wouldn't really know it look&nbsp;&nbsp; again well well it away from the target no you&nbsp; won't want to see that one back later tonight Cesc fàbregas Jordi Alba Iniesta Jordi Alba&nbsp;&nbsp; they could pose some danger&nbsp; now the shut up OTP Barcelona when I swung in goes for it with a fist Samuel MTT now he's looking for support&nbsp; still a chance in there of the goalkeeper&nbsp;&nbsp; Victor Moses well then show them the inside that's not gone according to the script&nbsp; here just take their moments depending did he get the fool that booth&nbsp;&nbsp; we start the game to what Jared daily fails Willian espenak Quetta being closed down Ghirardelli fail it's messy even rocket ish Sergio Roberto said&nbsp; true I like the look of this attack&nbsp;&nbsp; Messick come off the goalkeeper&nbsp; still it will be a three kick Cesc fàbregas some to move all the time&nbsp; and makes lots of these interceptions&nbsp;&nbsp; it goes out wide again and now any esta okay with the corner comes a possibility of&nbsp; increasing their lead here attack is&nbsp;&nbsp; the best form of Defense they&nbsp; say swung in from the corner the shop well Jodi Alva because the defender can cope with it easily&nbsp; Victor Moses tonight scenario here on the ball the opposition hold the on that Chelsea really&nbsp; challenging them now it's come to an end now&nbsp;&nbsp; as the referee calls a halt I've been quite&nbsp; dressed with them today and what about you&nbsp;&nbsp; they've got to win they have got to win and&nbsp; they've got some confidence onboard some&nbsp;&nbsp; players who who they can find the back of the&nbsp; net to well how do you think luis suarez did&nbsp;&nbsp; in the game today got himself a goal and put&nbsp; in a really good shift excellent performance

 today we have match of global interest for&nbsp; you it's fast learner against Real Madrid&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'm Martin Taylor Alan Smith is with me&nbsp; and what hasn't been said that's been said&nbsp;&nbsp; a million times about this game it's it's&nbsp; thrilling Alan it is you look at those two&nbsp;&nbsp; teams down there the superstars the sheer depth&nbsp; of talent in both and barely disappoints does it well they're not messy it's such a&nbsp; privilege to watch him play well he's got&nbsp;&nbsp; the ball on the string has the Oh Minnie's&nbsp; mesmeric to watch can't get it off of him always filled watching Real Madrid Alan&nbsp; that you know this every kid's dream to&nbsp;&nbsp; come and join them it's a wonderful&nbsp; reputation for attracting the best&nbsp;&nbsp; young talent when they come to the fore&nbsp; in other countries just something magical&nbsp;&nbsp; about that all-white kid as a kid dream a&nbsp; fight for this side and any lad is the same Barcelona's line up here well we know on how&nbsp; they'd like to play with plenty of possession as a&nbsp;&nbsp; short passage expecting exactly the same from the&nbsp; we'd imagine so wouldn't you that is their default&nbsp;&nbsp; setting as it were and that's the opposition&nbsp; you've got to stay so organized and you've&nbsp;&nbsp; got to work so hard it's not again he looked&nbsp; forward to really this is the round Madrid lineup&nbsp;&nbsp; mentality in this lineup pressing the&nbsp; opposition into making mistakes and&nbsp;&nbsp; cashing in on it straight away well it takes&nbsp; a lot of energy a lot of motivation accedes to&nbsp;&nbsp; drop off when you do drop off the aggressive&nbsp; closing down that's when it can fall down El Clasico is underway Sergio Busquets even rocket h13 you impaling luis suarez stop by the goalkeeper to cut out the bass essentia striding forward purposefully trying&nbsp; to lift it over the nearest defender he couldn't luis suarez pequeno Jordi Alba even rocket each little messy but a space to go forward into with the&nbsp; ball in the middle it's Coutinho papers&nbsp;&nbsp; bought and question about that is a weak&nbsp; cross really Gareth Bale where he can do&nbsp;&nbsp; some damage here out wide great chance to go&nbsp; in front that's great work by the goalkeeper Pitino Luis Suarez we well to keep the ball that's good&nbsp; support as they build this attack continue Suarez here in fact there has&nbsp; to be quick portrait janetrose Marcela it's with Marco essentia it's going to be a real target&nbsp; for victory for Real Madrid here&nbsp;&nbsp; don't get complacent they should&nbsp; be able to achieve their goals he's way off target quick-witted and quick in this&nbsp; movement to to intercept there&nbsp;&nbsp; Accela very close is casimiro&nbsp; guiding the past through Thank You Roberto now casimiro Coutinho they can't be quick on the break&nbsp; now kept the ball but the counter-attack&nbsp;&nbsp; was the chance you felt and that just&nbsp; faded away Sergio Ramos clears it here Dembele I could have got through there but&nbsp; the defender was absolutely on top of his game not rich mark o/s shots on here&nbsp; good work by the goalkeeper Dembele while the white man&nbsp; can show his skills here this turnover could be costly against&nbsp; the side that can break like this that'll run straight through to the goalkeeper Marcela is casimiro even rocket hitch free-kick&nbsp; conceded by him yellow card Oh Gorgo was that just the case of mistiming&nbsp; the tackle didn't look comfortable&nbsp;&nbsp; going into it and he was a definite foul cut out by Sergio Busquets then bail a the shots on my it's awesome miss&nbsp; attacking strengthen they've got they lead again&nbsp;&nbsp; and they'll be feeling they're going to head for&nbsp; victory again such a difficult thing to score&nbsp;&nbsp; on a regular basis at this level of football but&nbsp; they have found the answer they've got the formula&nbsp;&nbsp; well they call it his weaker side&nbsp;&nbsp; took a little chance there have been rewarded&nbsp; for I want to see this again let's go by late portrait Barcelona now enough about this&nbsp; fixed ship that being in front of&nbsp;&nbsp; this stage with halftime approaching is no&nbsp; guarantee yeah it's not a big margin is it for Barcelona Pitino's corner the goalkeeper&nbsp; takes charge here from the corner Cuttino dembélé that's easy luis suarez saw the ball went for it gross&nbsp; Marcela it's one of the best Martin it just&nbsp;&nbsp; shifting across we get at us looking good this&nbsp; move couldn't keep it Tony Krause moderate hey we've gone into some traffic&nbsp; but it could be dangerous here for&nbsp;&nbsp; the opposition red to play well shot blocked here&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 crows hey the chance goalkeeper exposed they'll hear as the halftime whistle go we're featuring here has done well&nbsp; he's certainly been an influence on&nbsp;&nbsp; this first half well he played really&nbsp; well dip knee and he got himself a&nbsp;&nbsp; goal to put his team ahead he'll be&nbsp; pleased with that first 45 minutes and El Clasico is underway well this is the second half now it's underway just working away to try and find an opening Sergio Busquets luis suarez now it's us man Dembele it's offside Podrick hey kids and you power but not too much direction they're both kids they know Messi petunia now it's us man Dembele Jody Alba his push gas now that job taste of attacking quite typical really to work at&nbsp; the place and the that they put in on the training&nbsp;&nbsp; ground the managers got to predict believe&nbsp; in attacking football and he must be thrilled&nbsp;&nbsp; probably beyond even his wildest dreams they&nbsp; attack they school they attack play schoolmaster&nbsp;&nbsp; to now and if you keep going in to that sort of&nbsp; area the ball will drop for you and it dropped&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly for her that's the lesson to anybody&nbsp; into an adulterer keep getting into the positions&nbsp;&nbsp; with the 18-yard in the six-yard box and you&nbsp; will score just what they wanted here to to nil so happy in possession Tony Krause and his&nbsp; team are happy when he's got the ball as well&nbsp;&nbsp; yet makes this side tick could be a chance&nbsp; here they've got the ball into a good area Leonel messy Karim Benzema great interception time to Real Madrid to just&nbsp; tinker with the team a bit with a substitution potamia into septic well now this is an interesting attack every&nbsp; sees that as a foul and it is a free kick there's going to be an alteration&nbsp; now and with the team trailing you&nbsp;&nbsp; can understand why he's going&nbsp; to make it it's normally good&nbsp;&nbsp; from these set plays and his teammate to&nbsp; expecting a good ball in Marco Ascencio casimiro moderate its moderate well that just&nbsp;&nbsp; shimmers with quality does&nbsp; their mattress watertight important for them to get the next goal&nbsp; and they've got it and they're still in&nbsp;&nbsp; the contest well there's an opportunity&nbsp; for the winning team to shut up shop but&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure they're capable of it the goal&nbsp; wherever you look at it it was very well taken and we restart the game 2-1&nbsp; even rocket itch luis suarez piqué building steadily here keeping possession&nbsp; now it's luck shut up that's a good block&nbsp;&nbsp; knocked away a lot Jordi Alba became here&nbsp; racket itch shut up he's skimmed the top&nbsp;&nbsp; of the bar here I think the keeper was&nbsp; probably comfortable but decent effort it's East go Tony Krause Real Madrid looking good here spread&nbsp; the intentions of the opposition&nbsp;&nbsp; there to make the interception still 20&nbsp; minutes to go even racket in bikini on you really get at your position here the balls&nbsp; loose goalkeeper made the save but he couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; hold it cleared away by the goalkeeper ground&nbsp; Madrid will make the substitution now now casimiro it's messy and that will end the&nbsp; threat at least for the moment&nbsp;&nbsp; activity on the bench for the losing team&nbsp; a substitute getting ready to come on I see Sergi Roberta even rocket ish petunia&nbsp; has got the ball back well the defender&nbsp;&nbsp; keeping the ball is one way to manage this&nbsp; situation for Barcelona they're pretty good at&nbsp;&nbsp; that trying to protect this advantage against rail&nbsp; great pulled from bail for Real Madrid increasing&nbsp;&nbsp; frustration here they continue to trail but&nbsp; they should have been level and certainly&nbsp;&nbsp; should have it wasn't a difficult chance is&nbsp; he going to be one of those days the manager&nbsp;&nbsp; seems to think so look at his expression&nbsp; what a chance missed that was to go level measured composed in control barcelona not really&nbsp;&nbsp; hurried out of their relaxed and stylish&nbsp; stride here and they're going to get the&nbsp;&nbsp; success that they thoroughly merit&nbsp; went to see a situation and on egos it's still danger here after this half clearance and on the clock eight more minutes&nbsp; keeping an eye on the time here we&nbsp;&nbsp; still could have a decisive moment&nbsp; in the short time that remains oh what a guy this is turning&nbsp; out to be to the height rayul Madrid have drawn level it looks&nbsp; as though they were going to lose but&nbsp;&nbsp; they've just not given up on it no&nbsp; and the way the last four days have&nbsp;&nbsp; gone you could see it coming and we can&nbsp; see a slightly different viewpoint on it the game restarts at 2-2 luis suarez Leonel Messi that's it taken by Messi first lie to get the throat Dembele&nbsp; they've got the ball back by that interception Gareth Bale the numbers gone up as far as added time is&nbsp; concerned it's for yeah and there's a sense&nbsp;&nbsp; of anticipation within this ground they think&nbsp; they've got a decent enough chance now to do the&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary Real Madrid is still on the attack&nbsp; in the closing moments here is still shut up it's ESCO Marcela he's a fruitcake cleared away well away from goal time ticking away&nbsp;&nbsp; there is the final whistle the team&nbsp; still level here after 90 minutes well we're all level after 90 minutes&nbsp; so it's on to extra time it's under way continue sergio busquets now Messi Sergi Roberto Messi try dr. block it's not really going&nbsp; to get the better of it from that&nbsp;&nbsp; range especially when you can see it&nbsp; all the way look as fast gets 20 pros Accela now casimiro Marcello Coutinho they're bailing but his face for it now out on the wing&nbsp;&nbsp; the impelling here's a chance to get&nbsp; their noses in front from the corner and goes to corner it again&nbsp; he didn't hang on to the ball I spotted the pass and cut it out tiny work from Barcelona they might have played&nbsp; him in here that's the referee's decision shut up&nbsp;&nbsp; really hit well but didn't trouble the goalkeeper&nbsp; here maybe a little Seiter for him there there's going to be some activities&nbsp; from the bench for Barcelona second period of extra time to come and still&nbsp; the chance the penalties might decide it all here the teams have turned round quickly and the&nbsp; second period of extra time underway straightaway let's go couldn't hold on to the&nbsp; ball I think the wide bands got&nbsp;&nbsp; a chance here this space out near&nbsp; the touch line he's read that has&nbsp;&nbsp; knee and made the interception made it&nbsp; look easy actually Oh a bus gonna try&nbsp;&nbsp; his luck and turned away by the goalkeeper&nbsp; spectacularly Barcelona winning a corner they've just pulled in from Messi good&nbsp; clearance from Sergio Ramos a chance oh let's take it now casimiro Tony closed well defended&nbsp; not just getting across we talk quickly&nbsp;&nbsp; as well here's the shot it's awesome&nbsp; it's attacking strap that they've got ahead for victory again such a difficult thing&nbsp; to score on a regular basis at this level of celebration when you get to its he is&nbsp; failing that special delight at the dr. hi seven minutes to go in the second half of extra&nbsp; time Charlie crows oh it's had some chances Alan&nbsp;&nbsp; Billis awhile since we've had a goal they've&nbsp; still got the lead yeah they're knocking the&nbsp;&nbsp; ball about with a fair bit of confidence and they&nbsp; look pretty secure with this lead at the moment and to pay for a throw and they've thrown up all the way&nbsp; there literally to the opposition&nbsp;&nbsp; away well away from gold too and it's left&nbsp; in the second half of extra time is Casa Mira&nbsp;&nbsp; it's won back praise for time the shot Alan&nbsp; those teammates aren't too happy look for a&nbsp;&nbsp; moment as though that might be challenging&nbsp; the goalkeeper but he's able to watch it go&nbsp;&nbsp; over the bar a bit over-ambitious of ink and&nbsp; some of his teammates are telling him that and the time to be added on here is a minimum&nbsp; of three minutes crafting the through parts&nbsp;&nbsp; very straightforward piece of dough&nbsp; keeping as he catches the cross series the guy every ten&nbsp; times and two beads to be here

 it's a friendly between two countries  that have a real rivalry no love lost  between them at all and we should expect  Alan a firecracker of a match nothing so  two two giants of the world game endures  so many fantastic talents in both of  these sides  this match is Brazil against Argentina  we talk about the highest level that a  player can achieve Alan you have the  honor of playing for England and we've  got two national teams here today oh  it's always a special moment you pull on  your nations shirt always a big game  this is no different      Brazil's lineup today is this  we've got it down as a 4-3-3 yeah it's a  system that the Netherlands used to use  all the time I think really they  invented it and plenty of countries have  adopted it since  if it works it's tough to handle    know how to pay tribute here at old  trafford to great names of the task  we're looking across at the Alex  Ferguson stand from the Bobby Charlton  stand yeah it's a marvelous theater no  doubt and I'm sure when they're trying  to track players they only have to show  them round Old Trafford and case has  been won  Argentina with this liner Sergio Romero  plays a go at Anglia no messy partners  up with Mauro Akari      and away we go with Brazil getting us  underway      it could lay it off to the supporting  player fantastic start  really quick off the blockchain  given themselves that terrific booze for  what lies ahead  well you get a lot of satisfaction  there's a goalscoring forward for  knocking one in from that distance you  know you're in the right place now it  was approaches effort the final finish  wasn't difficult but to get there took a  little bit of instinct    Brazil have delayed  here's a copy    my first World Cup Alan is a commentator  1978 in Argentina one by Argentine good  vision  shut up the chance did open up for that  kind of shot if you don't ever go    they bar    Raziel have a corner  and from Neymar really away from the  threat here  they bar  chuckle here today des  Nicholas autumn ending  okay get straight to it didn't  it's very well cut out at an important  time just cleared downfield not a proper  pass because the pressure is so intense  opening them up with a through pass to  go in from here    keep the ball here under some pressure  the trustees goalkeepers footwork here  with a back pass    neighbor he's one-on-one with the  goalkeeper    that's really the way to get the ball  out of the danger zone Akari  all right is  now it's back with Brazil    excellent vision  and it goes for the chip just widely the  target      Academy  sorry coming cut it out good work  ah  strong powerful clearance    never quite as simple as you think to  throw a ball to one of your teammates    now Bessie  pataki well here  striding forward purposefully Accardi    well the equalizer has happened perhaps  the opposition by surprise but we're  level again it's what they've deserved  well there's a goal worth replaying over  and over again isn't it    so away we go at what all Brazil  standards they're pretty well matched up  for this game so they know they're going  to have to play to their full potential  and that potential of course is awesome  lovely fall  go go  perhaps well they managed to get out of  harm's way there because it looked as  though there was going to be some real  damage done to them    Oh watch a tackle to break up the play  well they have cleared a danger it was a  decent opportunity I think  Madana  here's met shots on here cried for his  second goal of the game watered by the  keeper this done yeah and that's a good  stop and stayed on his toes good  reactions we've gone short with the  corner I see    a good example this was was just about    that spice that was the good bit didn't  they get it right  the trajectories of  the contact with the head but when you  can do that when you can jump Mikey can  he's such a strong player very hard to  stop    Brazil I'm trailing visited vicinity  they BA could be dangerous  across the salt  across this cause the defense any  problems are certainly not the  goalkeeper certainly wanting to find the  teammate but he's just found an opponent  third for Argentina    pushed us  lose his possession  I just stretch the opposition using the  wider areas here it's not really away  more clearance Bacardi  Nicholas autumn ending three minutes  from the referee by the fourth official  that's the decision regarding added time    to the ball fabulous clearance  will it be Patricia so the goal that  went for it there are level that is the  equalizing goal  a Gotham Noma and well that's abated the  keepers grasp a really good finish of  him  let's take another look at the goal    extraordinary game here two very well  matched teams and their trading goal for  goal in the game so we're halfway  through    here at old trafford the second half is  underway    it's messy    Leonel messy  guiding it through lips to go kick her  in the eye car to close the cross to the  keeper    out on the flank    but add up a chance to break away now on  the counter  what about Neymar in the first half  Allen well really good late equalizing  goal and that might just changed the  managers team talk now  look at this attack  and here's the shot that's a good clock  had to come back into his own half to  get hold of possession here  short passes and keeping the ball proper  clearance well away from the danger zone  Argentina ready to use a substitute  hey MA root for the cross    that's good play by the defender  how do you messed up then it would have  cost a goal unsure they are    corner for Brazil  neymar on the set piece the corner  but he saved it on the line that'll be  another corner coming up they must  corner defended well    and how defensive have they become at  the moment they're sitting in their own  half and only on position pass the ball  around in front of them maybe they feel  they're not going to be hurt  shots on here and it's quite a wild  evident goal although we've got good  contact on the ball    they bar  neighbor it's another decent try but  we're still level of this match  it's gonna be changed here to Argentina      they've got some room out here in the  wide position  dibala preston run the ball well forward  so the goal of went for it that is one  of the great saves had no going to stop  that and no going to get a hand on it  what a stop  it's Brazil breaking forward  must take the lead here which they do in  good style now they played some good  football leading up to that Martin had  thoroughly deserved that goal    they all count the same but he won't  ever get an easier work no running joke  that he was there right place right time  let's see the replay now    what's the reaction going to be from  Argentina for the fact that they're now  trailing Nicolas autumn ending now Messi    dibala  it's a good way to Nick the ball back  quick thinking    dibala  I think the white man's got a chance  here this space out there the touchline  so we're coming down now towards the  last 15 minutes in on the goalkeeper  will chance now threading it through let  it go  we've got to admire the way he placed  the ball into the bottom corner of the  net but the goalkeeper was in the decent  position but he was helpless to stop  that one going in different angle on it  here    respective even more goals for two is  the score  dibala necklace Ottoman de Carrera  I spun through the past and copied out    they bow  he has been pressed there to running the  ball out of play well they've got to get  goals haven't they and the only way to  do it the manager thinks is to get  another attacker on it'll make the game  more open but he's got to take that risk  yeah he's got it and this lab will need  the service they need to get the ball  wide gets some good balls into the box  still seven minutes left on the clock  here's a copy    really getting at the opposition this  far up the pitch now in with a chance  not really tested the goalkeeper but  sometimes it can look a bit too easy he  made sure he made the save confidently  he did and he doesn't make too many  mistakes this that pushed us  dibala  they spread it out wide here just to get  some whipped into this attack well  they're having to defend out they so  he's come deep and he's got hold of the  ball and they can build off him  it's a very good interception and that  ball is gone nothing to indicate three  added minutes on a turnover in play here  with that interception  they know best  nice cut that out well well-read  I like the look of this attack Rahzel  I've got the word  the victory it's less so of course in a  friendly game but it's still better than  was beaten winning is a nice habit to  acquire his team of taking a step  towards doing that what did you make of  the way Neymar influenced this game  today are lots of energy lots of quality  and a good goal along with plenty of  chances can't ignore
 welcome to you all to the Emirates  Stadium as commentators and it's Martin  Tyler here along with Alan Smith today  you always want to be put on the game  the seas are still play Manchester  United and we're hit yet we'll certainly  are it's one of those matches where it  could define both teams season with the  back result so it's a huge match this is  a very intelligent young man as well  Romelu Lukaku is forging his career now  strong strapping Belgian striker what  about this prior four in his last three  games watch out today    one thing to look out for from this team  today is the way they try and win the  ball back within seconds of losing it  yeah and they don't do it individually  they get backed up by a team though they  hunt in packs you've got to do that he's  gonna do it with discipline  this is then the Manchester United liner  having to hire starts in go Ashley  starts with Luke shores the full-backs  for talkback place  ikkaku start he's been a tremendous for  recently    style in the Emirates Stadium in keeping  with thee what nearer the luxury that  the modern-day Premier League football  fan expects when he comes to a ground  yeah and there's not a bad seat in the  house is the whole seats are actually a  lot bigger than the old ones that hide  really uncomfortable ones and you cannot  complain about the viewing experience  here  well that's not so much an interception  as a poor pass  the money of mattock now lingard Lukaku  attacking well here rascal  cutting in now  the corner to come because of that  deflection put the corner in the middle  that's good defending young chance to  put it in the box from here and they get  it away  it's Jesse Linga  and his poor papa shots on him he's  blocked the shot well  couldn't keep it in play it's gonna have  to throw Henry McKee Tarija now Mickey  Tariana but Manchester United a real  match up today aim for a team of their  skill  attacking team that women up against sir  given her united client expecting big  things here  Kataria defended well    gonna play dead cleared away well away  from gold  like his hat  excellent interception shut up doors  closed well head - yeah briefly to get  the laces behind it  the money at matok  Romelu Lukaku    it's lingard he could cross it now  master keepers ball from the moment the  cross left his foot  Lukaku  it's Jesse lingo the parkin in  powerfully there  Nikita RIA  he's Andres Patera  the first goal of a game that they have  absolutely dominated very good play  defense opened up again but the  difference is this time when they put  the ball past the goalkeeper good finish  and they looking at very classy side at  the moment well it was only a semblance  of an opportunity really but he's turned  it into a great goal with the first-time  strike what I think he had a chance you  know to take her another touch he would  have been crowded out so what a decision  in front here at Manchester United    Mesut özil obama yang like a set  now Mickey Katya  well to keep the ball  his Herzl  shut up simple say for David to hire  Ashley young now Linga  as the interception    and some potential in this move that  it is a goal kick    it's a quick break come off the  goalkeeper still in play  that's his game is there intercepting    well this team's been played some good  stuff if I keep creating chances I'm  sure Mike would that was a decent effort  you know  now linka everything about manchester  united still seems to revolve around  post Sir Alex Ferguson achieved so much  and we always felt Alan didn't we that  it would be very difficult in the years  after he stood down as manager yeah I  mean he's left a huge void I think he  will go down as the greatest club  manager that's ever been I regard him as  that anyway so anybody coming into that  job is gonna find it hard living in his  shadow could be dangerous  never feet there to go inside his man  rashtra with the ball now  his map joke's on him    United  well let's take it  at a significant time will that come  back to haunt him they could have been  pulling ahead here you see it so often  they are still in charge of this match    let's cut out  Lukaku cleverly done  well he's coming a bit on the wild side  for Arsenal a yellow or dear oh dear  who's committed himself and maybe  looking not to get away  Paul Pogba he's a man to the big  occasion  on the wall jump there they all got off  the ground and they blocked the free  kick  safety first from the defender can't  blame him for that    he's sure now poor papa  you know ties that baffle drive close  enough to suggest have another go son  yeah strong shot hit the keeper saw it  coming all the way though  it's a very good interception    the Kataria ami at Alba Mia  good defensive clearance there now the  possibility for a cross danger was  looming large they've got themselves  back on the ball those ill now with  lacquer zet building steadily here  keeping possession  man ichika shut up it's hit the bar and  it's back in play  sure  could easily have been even Stephens but  if they keep on playing out here probate  with the past linger it's a brilliant  piece of intercepting their crucial time  in crucial positioning minutes I mean  the board has gone up to indicate three  added minutes  come on ichika now Macario  set through his herself  great work by the goalkeeper great hands  that's halftime at wonder Manchester  United with the second half now underway  and they are leading     that  it's put Adam  just read the intentions of the  opposition there to make the  interception    knocked away lock  Lindelof is Jesse lingard its Pereira  popa got it shut off now    that's a good performance isn't it Alan  from him in the first half yeah it's a  good first 45 minutes now Mickey Thalia  Manny Cheka a good challenge but the bar  still shaking Raisa that you could argue  that's against the gonna play  well if you keep going in to that sort  of area the ball will drop for you and  it dropped perfectly for her that's the  lesson to anybody  enjoy and a guardrail keep getting into  the positions in the 18-yard in the  six-yard box and you will score we can't  blame him the manager is delighted with  a character his team has shown to get  back into this game it is level both  sides have scored here now  sure  nemanja automatic  he's Andres Pereira is Jesse Linga  Romelu Lukaku  and here comes the support and here's  poor papa  how about a yacht  maybe the counter-attack is on here  the goalkeeper  well his laces behind that one is off  the bowl Pascal are going to bring on  some fresh legs  it's Carrera its Linga  put away entirely by Jessie Linga  throw-in to come his undress put ever  linka now Papa he's got it away Matich  young  talk about  rashtra with the ball now and here's the  shot got it  jakka  nobody  Macario  it's his goal    can really get at the opposition here  here's sure Rushford he's given the free  kick it's in a really trending position  turn  think the managers decided he wants to  that they player have a great individual  reception which he wouldn't get at the  final whistle he's getting an ovation  now as the substitution is made yeah and  well deserved  two shots too high maybe just leaning  back and that was the downfall in that  Aaron Ramsey  mr. Ursula Obama yeah  looking good this move a lot of  defenders between them and a dull but  they still got the ball  good defensive clearance there it goes  out from the header for a throne    Nick's diner now Mickey Talia with beza  ercel able to cut that out with some  sharp movement    Lukaku  Castiel make licks diner now a chance to  get a bit of width into this attack Nick  diamond wicket area that goes to Ursula  for the attack is to feed over the  goalkeeper that time come after the ball  well time ticking on just over 15  minutes to go  quick witted and quick in this movement  to to intercept there  Master yeah good vision mansion the  break is definitely on  Ramsey Mesut özil now Mickey carry on  and I'll defend it or just getting  across he thought quickly as well  counting down in the last ten minutes  here nine to go his sure opportunity in  a wider area    it's gonna be a substitution for Arsenal  we're playing mind games here as well as  the actual game of football lovely ball  cross it now  corner now  substitution in goes the  but away by the defendant  it won't be Ramsay    Rick Steiner  Aleksey whoa be now he's looking for  support got the opposition backpedaling  a little bit  and that's into the graphs of the  goalkeeper the hardest thing he'll have  to do today by any means  rational  my chest you know you're going to win  this game they've got to get a goal now    looking to decide the game from it the  decider should be  look at those fans amazing well you said  it Martin there aren't too many better  sets and these Romelu Lukaku rashly  look very good indeed that they the  referees final whistle and the scores  are level  
 have to find a winner and this is the  only way  badal steps up to take the first one  and he's found the next good penalty  completely wrong footed the keeper so  the ball is placed on the spot  dibala his next up Cooley dad what each  he just did what he was asked  so the second man in line I thought he  did really well to hold his nerve down  and score that penalty  and to kitchen his second man up keepers  come up trumps the keepers done  brilliantly to keep his eye on the ball  and makes it a great safe Barcelona can  go to ahead to to the good  Aventis countable to miss another one  great stop  keepers delighted we shall focus there  fantastic safe    Chesney must keep this out this is match  point oh that's an ugly stop from the  keeper he's good his teammates crowd

great confidence that's  a superb spot kick    you ventus at the point of no return  it seemed he's kept them in it yeah it's  a guessing game for the keeper and he  gets wrong and now we're into the realms  of sudden-death straight at the keeper  he's put that straight at the keeper  it's simply not good enough  Alex Santo just needs to keep his nerve  here what a Miss and that would have  sealed the win for them now it is  unforgiving miss and it could be over  our could tape keeper committed himself  good penalty completely run footed the  keeper Juventus must score to keep their  hopes alive yeah it's a guessing game  for the keeper and he gets wrong and now  we're into the realms of sudden death  he's played by    Chiellini true and it's here and now I  saved it  then the keepers

not going to let  that one in derry robbed a possession  continue good tackle  samwell MTT    on the ball luis suarez continue and  it's with Ksenia  and he has been ruled offside here can't  have been by an awful lot who I'm not  too sure but the linesman's got a better  view than I have Alexandra  Christiana Sergio Busquets  certain Roberto  now busquets and its Busquets carrying a  genuine threat here rather superbly to  take back position    regaining possession for his side  cleverly    Dembele sergio busquets  Sedona moving the ball swiftly and  finding themselves in a promising

confusion after good delivery to the box  they didn't the hearts clear  and open the back in the day        it's going that way to nail Yannick snap  Mandzukic Cristiano Ronaldo Chiellini  you Ventus  the old lady they know how to keep and  the goalkeeper at ease with the  situation well so he should be stand  easy save but it's still have to make it  and delivered by pianist    an abundance of

always told me to get on the front row  she taught you well Lee there we have it  the Champions League Victor's for 2019  
 hi there everybody  we've got quite an intense rivalry for  you in our main game today it's in  Chelsea against Manchester United  I'm Martin Tyler Allen Smith sitting  alongside me to score the team for  football skills and maybe for aggression  as well because this has been built up  this game hasn't it yeah it has I mean  he's got a special ring to it  going down the years not just in this  era we've had some marvelous contests to  Teebs  a drink today as well such a feature of  this game gotta keep that eye on for him  top scorer in the league with seven so  far        here's the Chelsea Lana I spell equator  starts alongside David Lewis in the  heart of the defense and then as I start  a midfielder in good form  Murata is the sole striker today    this is the Manchester United line  does it go Antonio Valencia starts with  Luke shores the full-backs  in central midfield Roble Lukaku is the  sole striker today  take off in Chelsea  we're underway  we've got support here William  here's Murata well then it goes good  defensive clearance there  Murata William  and that will end the threat at least  for the moment could get his cotton now  how about over to cover Chooch  very quickly  William    here's contact Kovacic    some strong key possession it's such a  cool head good to God  captain's contribution here with a  Feingold was a good gone  crucial time a pic for he site Krypton's  input there    see  calling dr. Fred that's his game is  there intercepting  we'll try again it's gone again    Mississippi he rated the game for this  team to get one go was excellent but now  they've doubled their money    let's take another look at the girl    just widen the margin here to to nil  there was a Manchester United Chelsea  game at Stamford Bridge towards the end  of the 1415 season Chelsea did win the  game imagine I'd had all the ball there  was a most unusual smash and grab from  Josie Marino's man yes he parked the bus  at home almost there didn't he to get  the job done as they edged towards the  title trying to find an opening not  panicking got the tackle in he could  clear it here  matéo cover Chooch  and that's going to be a goal kick    right down the wing keeping the wide  attack going looking for teammates in  the middle he had to clear it even at  the expense of a corner here it is again  another look at Murata's go corner  played it it was a promising situation  that could have made more of that  Chelsea give it away saw the pass coming  and got there first    Haeju NASA had out in front of gold    could tell the keeper was pleased with  that and why wouldn't he be at the top  draw that same Lukaku  good reading of the play by the defender    the money of mattock  was whipped here for Manchester United  now the cross has gone behind for poor  effort    coverage  Marcus Alonso really trying to use the  full width of the pitch here to make  some progress  Hayden has her gives it away with Jesse  lingard the man yet mattock  trying to catch the other team out with  a quick break here hope ur incisive pass    well they were caught out here by this  quick counter-attack against the run of  play yeah I mean they had to stick  together there and come under a lot of  pressure but with the pace in the team  that was always lightly  if we go again to one  Murata Allen guard  like us alongside motel cover Cheech  the chance to attack    across this cause the defense any  problems is certainly not the goalkeeper  slipping it through his Linga gets his  cross in and they get it away  Alexis Sanchez  and goes out wide again they've been  thrown out after the tackle  well then it goes very straightforward  piece of goalkeeping as he catches the  cross    they passed not completed really  Valencia crushing it here moving from  one side to the other  opportunity to cross it now he works so  hard on his heading needs to do a bit  more well to think yeah Anna keepers  waving that one bye-bye big Greta  content Matteo coverage as a Murata  excellent vision    well they managed to get out of harm's  way that because it looked as though it  was going to be some real damage done to  them  popa trying to put his team made it saw  the pass coming and got there first  it was gonna be three minutes at a dog    Murata  he's sure  want to they're tight now  well this is half-time that's the  whistle and Here Come Manchester United  right at the start of the second half    Papa there's an easy cut out for the  opposition saw the past coming  yes Willie    defenders managed to get in the way  there    talk about    Romelu Lukaku  now Paul Pogba walked off the path there  good performance so far by Ed NASA will  be happy without fur we kept conceded by  Antonio Valencia clearly a booking  outcomes the yellow car when he reached  straight through his pocket he didn't  really think about it but I think that's  the good court towards them involved  here Virginia  good position for the cross    it's one back that's good movement  forward here    shops drop very quickly to another  corner that deflection  72 Mary place Barney let's run some  water  swung in from the corner the mantis  by the goalkeeper    Lindelof Sanchez Alexis Sanchez stay  true just nicked it away from the  attacker the goalkeeper  Jesse Linga and here comes the support    that he's one of the best in the  business from those got a situation  absolutely brilliant goes to corner  takes charge here from the corner    coming up  substitute coming on to try and repair  the damn    matéo cover Chooch  anticipated the direction of the pass  and is able to intervene  delivered towards Murata defended well  tonio Valencia  but true-bypass yeah Lukaku  but how did Manchester United miss that  one they're still trailing well he'll  get some stick off the fans if they get  nothing for this match that's been a  greater my tale cover Chooch  it has it  as a fastest man  very straightforward save for the  goalkeeper  he's sure sure    Alexis Sanchez he spotted a teammate and  has got the technique as well as the  vision to switch to play  delivery to the far post that's a  brilliant volley it deserved better just  clipping the frame of the goal or the  crowd enjoyed that one on two feet we  people each scored with it  I'm gonna contact  cottage gone out over the touchline  that'll be a throw to the opposition  Chris Smalling    Bigelow  Romelu Lukaku sure crushing it here  moving from one side to the other  Palencia  Anthony Marcia  there's a drive and some power but  off-target yeah I'm looking quite get  set for that one  absolutely quitter  Marcus Alonso a test for the durability  of Chelsea here to hold off Manchester  United in these closing minutes but I've  got some across the defense any problems  are certainly not the goalkeeper well I  have played in a controlled way Chelsea  winning at half time they still have the  lead  Manchester United need to find some  fighting spirit here there a goal down  we've got 10 minutes left on the clock  putting a bit too hard trying to force  the pass in it straight to an opponent  I've worked so hard the team to be in  front here  and that's been recognized by the  supporters yeah I think they recognized  that it has been a really good  performance but still a bit of work to  do  at each    but get his got it now Cote  that's a good book  Sanchez  Alexis Sanchez guided truth Lukaku    Mateo cabotage Marcos Alonso as a  the other content    poverty  a class act isn't a player's  given aside yeah he's playing on the  shoulder that just needs to hold his  monitors  one minute left on the clock    as a final whistle it's a win for  Chelsea  hard thought this wind to very evenly  matched teams here sometimes it feels  even better than if you were to win  three or four nil  it has out in his usual impish form here  today it's one thing picking this lad  out to try and stop him it's another  thing actually accomplishing that feat  he's in really good form another goal  and another win for his team

the free kick I  don't he's gonna produce the yellow card  Pepe but he would have come here  expecting this type of reaction today  idiot sir Gareth Bale  met Simone  good challenge  tefik  trying to get behind the defenders to  get it a good cross  good strong challenge  they bark they've got the ball back  through a very good interception Modric  you want to get the ball early he's got  it now  he'll Garamendi  an ambitious effort that it nearly  produced the great reward he has scored  from those comma distances not this time  his mascara No  Daniel Alves  Leonel messy  Sergio Busquets  damar was heavy on this attack been a  menace to it got the tackle in he's an  old-school player that defend it he'll  not worry about the niceties just clear  his lines you've done that I've got a  player to take the throw in this attack  area Sergio Busquets  got to be SAS quality in the Builder the  brilliant finish a wonderful goal  classic really has clicked into play  here and the opposition had no answer  the movement and the way that the ball  was played to the guy who scored the  goal was of a very high order and you  can only do that when you play with full  confidence at the top of your game this  lot adds here  was BAM  that's a vital stop little messy  they bar  he might go for goal here the defenders  just managed to deal with that Benzema  Leonel messy  Metro  here's the cross they go brilliant henna  was superbly taken coming in from the  right  that was so invited wonderful delivery  great ball great goal well it was just  perfect from the delivery to the finish  top marks its Turner  don't plan to tackle  now Messi  now Kenny's go oh it's hit very well in  the goalkeeper was strong  and now Bessie  what a chance here oh and he's put it in  for the goal  with that goal and it should wrap it up  for Barcelona well I would have thought  so surely no way back now  Barcelona's very quickly into their  stride today they're doing brilliant  Gareth Bale it's across from Gareth Bale  the defend  with that cross that's the referee  signalling for hard time blowing his  whistle and it's three nil here at  halftime the manager of the winning team  or just have to get his players of  motivated  could be more even in the second half  the coaches have a chance to talk to the  players and certainly the team that's  conceded the goal will be hoping that  they've tightened things up a bit good  challenge here Pedro  Benzema  fine bail that's easy for the defender  to easy really they'll be disappointed  with the poverty really of the attacking  play at the moment and the tackle is  made and now they can capitalize on this  damar  we've got here two very well matched  teams one has played bright potential  and the other quite clearly hasn't yeah  I mean you can experience an off day  the losing team certainly is but  deciding the league what I've taken the  chance is bullying  the ball at the moment you'll Garamendi  quadrant  illya romantic  it's a good idea to try and use the wind  on the pitch but it's gone out for a  throne real Madrid have a substitute  getting ready Sergio Busquets it's messy  and the opponents come in strongly  Shirley's gonna score here and he takes  the shot  not this time from Leo Messi when he  gets into so many of these positions he  has to miss a few  Sergio Busquets  it's messy he has been playing  absolutely on top of his game today yeah  he hasn't been King the ball into him  any height and you know he's gonna keep  he's got the gold  looking to take the corner quickly  and it comes the header up he went and  the Heather it just couldn't keep it  down I did most things right there found  himself in some space and got up early  petrol  Sergio Busquets  charge for it here's the shot Victor  Valdes that's a real victory for a  goalkeeper in a one-on-one situation he  did it splendidly  looking for ESCO  I think it's really hard probably the  hardest part of officiating to get these  offside calls right they do it much more  often than not don't they well you get a  fraction of a second extremely difficult  job I wouldn't want to do it back to  cristiano ronaldo cristiano ronaldo  there's no let-up is there in the  hostility towards him  across the cherry Alonso good  interception by the defender Leonor  messy  Pedro the countdown is on we're into  nine minutes now promising ploy for the  chance to grab the ball at the feet of  the attacking player the strike could  have got his foot to it and it's in a  while I think it'd have been a penalty  Pedro midfield they've got it backfire  an interception  for the chance to grab the ball at the  fate of the attacking player I could  have got his foot to it and nicked it a  Wilding in a bit of penalty Leonel Messi  it's one back Roderick  now you'll get it back again  try to reach Benzema the guys who go  right on the trend  when I kick the ball out of the net on  the trip to try and get it back for the  restart but games over it is skin  consolation for them and the score line  is 3-1 that's the moment for at least  the fans to treasure they've seen their  team score today but not too much in the  grand scheme of things is it know I  realized that the the game is up that  the result is decided but always nice to  get a consolation and the referee has  ended it here  I'm not a jack
 Real Madrid on the day that Barcelona come&nbsp; a-visiting Martin Tyler here along with&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan Smith Alan yeah can't wait for this one&nbsp; Martin when you think down the years of the&nbsp;&nbsp; contest the goals the theatrics sometimes but&nbsp; various players but there's never a dull moment it's Cristiano Ronaldo against Luis Suarez well&nbsp; Cristiano Ronaldo he's known for his head in&nbsp;&nbsp; ability when he scored some goals that weis and&nbsp; spectacular wants to ask for Luis Suarez he's a&nbsp;&nbsp; master of interplay of making those little want to&nbsp; give and goes accelerating onto the ball this is&nbsp;&nbsp; the Real Madrid lineup Keylor Navas in gold cava&nbsp; how it starts with Marcelo as the pull backs Luka&nbsp;&nbsp; Modric starts returning throws in the center of&nbsp; the park Karim Benzema is the lone striker today Barcelona's lineup here mark&nbsp; and Rita Stegen starts in gold&nbsp;&nbsp; PK starts with Samuel um Chitti is&nbsp; the center box and he Esther plays&nbsp;&nbsp; with human racket in midfield Luis&nbsp; Suarez is the lone striker today it's an honor isn't it to be here at the&nbsp; bernabéu it is an iconic football stadium&nbsp;&nbsp; and Real Madrid stand for so much that's good&nbsp; in the game it has got a certain magic attached&nbsp;&nbsp; to it and I have to say up into all the&nbsp; big stadiums in Europe in the world and&nbsp;&nbsp; this is my favorite it's magnificent that day&nbsp; ladders about ready to get the game underway El Clasico is underway neatly intercepted is casimiro look at this attack you could get a cross&nbsp; in hit it wasn't an early foul write to&nbsp;&nbsp; the referee to say yeah well that's the&nbsp; free-kick and you know you can't do that trying to get closer to the ball the&nbsp; wall referees got the card out here&nbsp;&nbsp; for the offender they shouldn't get&nbsp; booked for that lack of discipline well with him you know he's going to go&nbsp; for gold but he's that better if it's&nbsp;&nbsp; many of them not be surprised if he is&nbsp; allowed to take the next one after that seller that's great defending they're&nbsp; stopping that attack luiz suarez&nbsp;&nbsp; is there any other fix yet&nbsp; creates such anticipation a magical rocket it uh no nn-no is&nbsp; miscued that one is scooty paddling it goes out wide again kind of a house is casimiro and they copied out go for that&nbsp; yellow card here just a free-kick and you poured the wool referee's&nbsp; had enough of this out comes the card for a free-kick that's the best exciter real isn't&nbsp;&nbsp; it yeah think he's shanked it you&nbsp; know that was a horrible connection and now any esta even rocket&nbsp; inch why too messy now messy I could go well it looks a bad mess&nbsp; think the defender she asked put him&nbsp;&nbsp; off yeah he's going to take a&nbsp; lot of credit for that because&nbsp;&nbsp; you have to take the shop quickly&nbsp; the laddie who's trying to score Rafael Farah is casimiro Iniesta clever pass from Suarez in&nbsp; for the charts that's well well a&nbsp;&nbsp; wide you'll take Alan on this effort&nbsp; from Iniesta well only he will know&nbsp;&nbsp; whether he was going for goal there in&nbsp; the end he nearly scored his Casa Mira gross now casimiro 30 cross Marcela I doubt - Cristiano Ronaldo in that wide area though he wants to take them on ESMA now with Marcello ESMA here's the shot a corner for&nbsp; round the trip he's got support here 20 close now shut up full extension the&nbsp; goalkeeper makes the save corner go it's a face an effort that with plenty of&nbsp;&nbsp; sting in it yeah not far away&nbsp; and we we keep visit did me the manager just trying to get his message across&nbsp;&nbsp; down there the work part of taking&nbsp; the lead there apply pretty well&nbsp;&nbsp; and now any está moving forward with some danger&nbsp; to the opposition now they're here&nbsp;&nbsp; quite slow to their stride&nbsp; rail Madrid today Sergio Ramos and Ronaldo wired to Leo Messi possibilities for&nbsp; Barcelona now the shot to make the save&nbsp;&nbsp; now a corner for Barcelona and it's taken&nbsp; time to hit the corner trepkos gets it away the post could have come out but anyway&nbsp; you're too young to remember alum at least&nbsp;&nbsp; have square go close and a lot more&nbsp; came out that went in in those days&nbsp;&nbsp; so for the attackers that's a bonus of the&nbsp; changing the technology in off the post yeah&nbsp;&nbsp; and I think he deserved that know because&nbsp; struck it well and going into the corner it's possible in trucks portrait even rocket ish onto the attack now come away with&nbsp; the ball clearly great tackle close well courage Johnny crows raphaël Varane come about how Roderich yo Renaldo well this attack menace to it when zermat gives away the free kick here now casimiro they could pose some&nbsp; danger now Roderich tackle here Lilly Suarez that's it got to keep his nerve here run in front&nbsp; they would be a lot more comfortable if&nbsp;&nbsp; they were to in front and they really could&nbsp; have been yeah might they look back on that&nbsp;&nbsp; with a bit of regret because that was a&nbsp; great chance to extend the lead wasn't it Sergio Ramos Cristiano Ronaldo they're in a good position here tried to&nbsp; tackle here and he's done that Ghirardelli&nbsp;&nbsp; fail even racket each so it's one nil&nbsp; here as the half-time whistle girl&nbsp;&nbsp; a player but we're featuring here has done&nbsp; well he's certainly been an influence on&nbsp;&nbsp; this first half well he played really&nbsp; well big day and he got himself a goal&nbsp;&nbsp; to put his team ahead he'll be pleased&nbsp; with that first four to five minutes&nbsp;&nbsp; here in the Bernabeu we're&nbsp; underway in the second half Renaldo really getting at the&nbsp; opposition this far up the pitch now&nbsp;&nbsp; and now he's looking for some&nbsp; support here's the shot take it eliza has happened perhaps the opposition by&nbsp; surprise but we're level again what they deserved&nbsp;&nbsp; let's take another look at the goal his level both sides have scored here now even&nbsp; racket each Samuel TT Sergio Busquets not rich&nbsp;&nbsp; tacky well here Cristiano Ronaldo support play from his teammates to make the save for his a chance to&nbsp; get their noses in front from the corner swanny named by crows casimiro shops&nbsp; dropped very quickly it's a corner again goes to the corner any ester even Rakuten sergio busquets to put them in front my way through says novice&nbsp; to the side well he smiled after that one short the corner this done all right getting the ball back and thinking&nbsp; attack you might be true today Rises it's been wasted really to&nbsp; the near post Leonor messy Iniesta luis suarez Barcelona moving smartly here that&nbsp; is a free-kick and they've got a&nbsp;&nbsp; chance to really make the most&nbsp; of that decision Iniesta is off under turret right goalkeeper great&nbsp; save that move nipped in the bud by&nbsp;&nbsp; the raising of the flag from the&nbsp; assistant to me like the timing&nbsp;&nbsp; of the pass and the gun was spot-on&nbsp; but closer inspection now it was off tiny pros Partridge in control and Tony Krause always knows what he's&nbsp; going to do with the ball before he receives it project clearly a free-kick Sergio Busquets even rocket it getting forward well as a team now Terron that&nbsp; significant because they're now into the lane well he got to the position of maximum&nbsp; opportunity it was an impossible opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp; to sponder yet we often say to these&nbsp; chants but you have got to be there&nbsp;&nbsp; this lad has got the knack of doing them&nbsp; Real Madrid have gone behind in this game Gareth Bale Calabar ha now casimiro right forward a&nbsp; bit of menace in this attack the challenge&nbsp;&nbsp; benefiting from the referees&nbsp; interpretation of that play on advantage luis suarez kind of a house now casimiro chuggy crows what this attack&nbsp; I've been a menace to it great reflexes the carnosine any&nbsp; people would be paired up corners taken&nbsp;&nbsp; here's the shot shot blocked&nbsp; hit corn account rising swung in from the corner good offensive clearance&nbsp; there Real Madrid the goal the drift time against&nbsp;&nbsp; them they've got such quality still but the crowd&nbsp; are doing the best to urge their players on here&nbsp;&nbsp; and time these running out well Madrid a goal&nbsp; behind here still coming on strong looking to&nbsp;&nbsp; play their way through now got their equalizer the&nbsp; very least they deserve for this game taking away&nbsp;&nbsp; from them the way they've dominated the play&nbsp; they've had so much of a bore the opposition&nbsp;&nbsp; resistances find event growth well this is the&nbsp; team informant these players today and they've&nbsp;&nbsp; got their reward here he looked at all of the&nbsp; mail once again the squirrel sheep all drifted for two teams brilliantly matched in&nbsp; this contest it's level again tada incisive pass moving forward with some danger&nbsp; to the opposition now they're here moderate Sela Karim Benzema same with the tackle gross Benjamin here they are on the attack Sergio Busquets Tony Krause the numbers gone up&nbsp; as far as added time is concerned&nbsp;&nbsp; it's for yet and there's a sense of&nbsp; anticipation within this ground they&nbsp;&nbsp; think they've got a decent enough&nbsp; chance nodes that do the necessary luis suarez some potential in this move&nbsp; it's a quick break chips so close the post he's given the free-kick he's what I could&nbsp; play this late in the game yeah signs that&nbsp;&nbsp; he'd lost his head actually and he was gonna&nbsp; get sent off having already been booked&nbsp;&nbsp; gross the scores level well we're off and running again after that period&nbsp;&nbsp; of rehydration refreshment they've&nbsp; got extra time now in front of them it's messy to cut that out some sharp movements Alba sergio busquets trying to stretch&nbsp; the opposition using the wider areas here&nbsp;&nbsp; Jarett Alafaya shreds it through trying&nbsp; to pick out messy and they've got it away&nbsp;&nbsp; from the danger whoosh guess Daler&nbsp; fail paulinho call that Barcelona corner played in we're able to take&nbsp; full advantage of a good position other track some move all the time and makes&nbsp; lots of these interceptions Benzema quadrant raphaël Varane Real Madrid looking good here as the interception good fishing we'll turn together into Barcelona just a case of miss timing the&nbsp; tackle well I think so the referee&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't need to make a mountain&nbsp; at least molehill but it is a foul and scores from the spot&nbsp;&nbsp; slide-rule stuff from the spot or&nbsp; probably the last man you want to&nbsp;&nbsp; face from the penalty is Leonor Messi and&nbsp; you can see why the goal wherever you look&nbsp;&nbsp; at it it was very well taken round&nbsp; Madrid have gone behind in this go&nbsp;&nbsp; crowd may be expected a bit&nbsp; more but to added minutes good position they've worked this attack very&nbsp; well into a quite a dangerous position their&nbsp;&nbsp; promising buildup challenge maybe the&nbsp; counter-attack is on here first period&nbsp;&nbsp; of extra time is over 15 minutes till&nbsp; to go and the possibility of penalties we've got 15 minutes left as we&nbsp; start the second period of extra time but I file para funny clothes now casimiro was good progress with this attack he's casimiro he's Cristiano Ronaldo intercepted luis suarez sérgio Roberta really getting at the&nbsp; opposition this far up the pitch now to the pool in his fate with this girl the equalizer has happened perhaps&nbsp; the opposition by surprise we're&nbsp;&nbsp; level again it's what they deserved&nbsp; not to go well worth analyzing again great use for the manager because I think he made&nbsp;&nbsp; a couple of changes there and&nbsp; now they're back on level terms I wonder where we go from here&nbsp; now that we're level again in&nbsp;&nbsp; the game anything could happen sergio&nbsp; busquets well if they want to avoid the&nbsp;&nbsp; penalty shootout they'd better&nbsp; store in the next five minutes right away well away from gold this casimiro Marcella who goes in Sergio Busquets nice return Pass luis suarez gets his crusted here comes the support shut up know where&nbsp; their nose is cute that one beauty badly&nbsp;&nbsp; and that's the referee's decision 200 minutes we have to praise the defenders of&nbsp; course and and that was a good piece&nbsp;&nbsp; of reading the play but could they&nbsp; have done better the attacking side and this is the first penalty here pressure on good stuff today it wasn't done of the box there just what you want at least&nbsp; eight and the penalty is Benzema to do is put it in the net of the shooter&nbsp; and he's done it plenty now Luka Modric to stop that one it's&nbsp; potentially much winning penalty to the PZ Connie these made it look easy there&nbsp;&nbsp; well there's a goal that perhaps not gone&nbsp; according to the script here we'll just pick their&nbsp;&nbsp; moment to get forward after a lot of defending&nbsp; yeah and they can thank the defenders for that but&nbsp;&nbsp; when they did get the ball they moved it forward&nbsp; really quickly they were they were ruthless there well you as a top striker in your time you&nbsp; must have appreciated what's happened here&nbsp;&nbsp; with all these goals and how well they&nbsp; were taken yeah I think it's been the&nbsp;&nbsp; reward for two sides being positive from&nbsp; the off and as a result we've seen plenty
 it's Christian her and Aldo against a  little messy  but you expect from their malady well  this yarn of an Aldo he's all about pace  about and stripping his defender it's  gonna be fascinating to see a sport  little messy he's known for his into  play got such quick feet knows how  tomorrow's is the lone striker today  Real Madrid and got the game started  here  Tony Krause  well played trying to reach Benzema  that's what no people didn't have to  move to make that so  they know Messi  break maybe from Barcelona juts out back  into five the crossbow  today  won't be easy for them Barcelona's ball  dani alves  well he slowed the guy could switch the  play too and came up with the past as  well excellent let's cut out that pass  it wasn't an accident he read the mind  of the opponent  they bah  now he's looking for support  Rodriguez  Karim Benzema was fail  Freud Corral Madrid  Roderich I just pressed your position  using the wider areas here after grabs  here  Yunel message  Peppe  Muppet here is the birthday boy come of  a house  tremendous understanding from these  pliers  Rodrigues  Jordi Alba  Mockridge  towards Rodriguez great work by the  goalkeeper the ball this his these made  sure he's protected it what really  happened so far for Barcelona  and it's gone out of play there  Jordi Alba any esta  well they've got support here as a bad  pass it's giving it straight to the  opposition  Rodriguez  is to be an opening to Real Madrid and a  go they've opened the scoring now  and Benzema that he's a wonderful cyfle  he knew exactly where the keeper was him  but he couldn't get there  so the first go it's one day  piqué it's a steamie welcome for a  player not very much liked in these  parts the drake is definitely on bow  all here  talk about placing it exactly what he  wanted to do with it  they march in here to to know  dirty how about  on towards messy  chips is just race hit the goalkeeper  call that Barcelona  that's hard time here in the Bernabeu  we're under way in the second half  Jordi Alba  carrot fail  any esta  he spotted a teammate and he's got the  technique as well as the vision to  switch to play well Gareth Bale has gone  through the first half here Alan what  did you make of his performance I will  be happy without first 45 minutes it was  a good goal from him but overall  performance actually opportunity now he  scored for our Madrid  go for Benzema well he's just tethered  to the right-hand side  daddy's a wonderful take  like riding the marching now three-nil  the lead  I'm pk there's no let-up is there in the  hostility towards him  Jordi Alba how about how  on to Ronaldo  substitude readies come on for Barcelona  luis suarez  then all messy trying to find Suarez or  they're losing by a lot today actually  now improved the situation  the Gulf and Suarez and the way he's  followed in the keep up really couldn't  get across rookie and up it's a  fantastic strike has to remind a31 it is  there the scholar  that bench Barcelona want to make a  change now here comes the support  Rodriguez  that's an easy intersection because the  past wasn't really a very thoughtful one  we've got a fist to it  it's a foul by Mathieu  Sergio Ramos  Rodrigues  lost possession here and they've got  their new man ready Barcelona to make  the change  Jordi Alba  they bar  our faith  kind of a how  piqué  towards neighbor we have a substitution  coming up and is coming up to Real  Madrid she ever me Matthew  towards Neymar  trying to stretch the opposition using  the wider areas here Sergio Busquets  so they could regroup now and the goal  came when you're outplayed in midfield  it's a really tough ask in a match of  this caliber  he has been outplayed in midfield he's  off now and it probably quite relieved  he's a player that likes to get his foot  on the ball to dictate the tempo but  never got close to doing that here  Karim Benzema  to hit this got in and blocked it on no  scraps for the attackers to feed on from  the goalkeeper that time hung on to the  ball well  goalkeeper with a textbook side and keep  the ball in his grasp that guy's these  final whistle the referee has blown and  the final score 3-1 ready now to go into  competitive action again you a trio  having won this friendly  yeah they look just about ready to me  I've settled into a system that they  look comfortable with let's get to some  final words from Alan Smith I'm Karim  Benzema  an important player today Alan well so  often we think of these creative  abilities but a couple of goals here and  one the match for each team  break maybe from Barcelona shut up  back into by off the crossbar Rodriguez  this could be an opening for Real Madrid  the shots home and a goal  they've opened the scoring now  the break is definitely on bail when you  go    he just hit the goalkeeper be happy  without first 45 minutes it was a good  goal opportunity now and he stole to  Real Madrid  little messy trying to find Suarez hitch  on the following rather losing by a lot  but they actually now improved the  situation  you
 Oh  you  you  hello once again I'm Martin Tyler and  this is Old Trafford  where's Liverpool against Manchester  United a girl of a certain age you'll  remember when Liverpool were top dogs in  the 70s and 80s and Alex Ferguson came  down from Scott will try and change that  he did Manchester United obviously in  the last decade of the last century the  first decade of this century he got what  he wanted but that rivalry still really  exists it doesn't if you ask the pliers  and particularly the fans they will say  this Derby is the one they looked to at  the start of every season  featured played for us today is planned  matter yeah and quite light - I think  he's one of those that went on top of  his game he really he's difficult to  stop because he pops up in those areas  finds those pockets of space  Roberto Firmino he's got priceless  ability on the ball he can manufacture  in tight spaces this is then the  Manchester United liner having the  highest arcing goal asked enshrines  dagger at Michael Carrick in the middle  and at the point of attack  just one lone striker  this is the Liverpool side-seam a mini  lay starting goal artists kurtal start  with a and love run as the center backs  and rach and plays with Lucas in the  middle Christian benteke is the sole  striker today  for long period this was a place where  Manchester United seemed to be totally  unbeatable then they've had one or two  changes of management of course we  should always likely to happen when I  like focus retired after so many years  the visitors have been able to come away  with points which they would never have  expected to get in the past yeah maybe  the fear factor has diminished and it's  up to the manager that's in place at a  time to try and build up back up again  for my part never scored here safe  what's the favorite ground of mine  to fit me nope  stop the attack here building  it's across  good play one on one it's good movement  they're getting forward here Manchester  United good play but they've lost the  ball now the opposition could get at  them it'll be a throw  sure  nothing wrong with that tackle in fact  it was a terrific effort it was a good  season 1415 for Manchester United they  did the league double over Liverpool and  they became an Old Trafford and  Liverpool actually played really well  but it would be three nil and that was  actually the start of kids a great work  by the keeper corner for Manchester  United  the lady days ago  go here now the keepers pulled off her a  really good save but that's when he  needs the help of these defenders  so the first goal is one nil and no  score excited  I'm 16  gomez  lovely  James Milner  Delaney  and he preached it well Emery Chan  Laughlin  gomez  and the throat with a bit of urgency  about it keep the attack going Daria  trying stagette  Eleni  good position they've worked this attack  very well until quite a dangerous  position now  ha  Eleni  James Milner  every channel  moved around nicely here with this  passing go  look clear the danger  that's coming in now  that will be a corner for Liverpool now  the chance to see Carrick's goal  and the goalkeeper coming up his line  he's got that through clever reading of  the game intercepting and getting  possession back for his team across his  blocked and in goes the cross and he  claims the cross from the flags up he's  frustrated because he is caught offside  maybe he made his run a bit too soon  and the cross comes in now  James Milner  we had a good look at that decided it's  just a TRO hearted attacking I'm very  confident to get the game moving again  trying to Liverpool  Nathaniel Klein skirt or  that is a free cake  was an easy decision for the ref when it  needs and saw the ball and he thought  you could win it but just as a faction  off  only two more minutes to be added on  he's met it with his head he's off  target and that  really was a big moment the equalizer  was beckoning but it wasn't a simple  chance but it really deserved a bit  better than that finish so it's one nil  here as the halftime whistle goes  well I like the look of this from the  neutral point of view Alan we're going  to get an extra attacker on for the team  that's done the better attacking that  are leading in the game now I want to do  sigh the best form of Defense his attack  and that's the principle he's taken here  the manager Michael Carrick  and decade  Christ I get  Lucas  James Milner back to him again Roberto  Firmino it's a free-kick against  Manchester United  a good skill just to lift a ball there  at the right moment well the player but  we're featuring here is done well he's  certainly been an influence on this  first half well he played really well  didn't he and he got himself a goal to  put his team ahead he'll be pleased with  that first 45 minutes lovely  Manchester United with the ball again  and Avera  substitution for Liverpool referee says  free-kick  well they're still trailing and they  need to do something now if they want to  get back into this game maybe some fresh  legs will do the trick  Nathaniel climb skirt is a cheap piece  of play to give the ball away like that  which finds target  really on top of their game now  wonderful understanding  shut up let's come up hip in with Hanna  and go  go burn for Manchester United oh that's  a lovely poachers gold  johnny-on-the-spot - tapping hope  that's why the margin here to jail  not a good challenge by the defender  spaced across the ball now let's see  useful ball in  it's all I've got a new man ready to  come on  that's the pass that's gone astray out  of clay  James Melda  Nathaniel climb  definitely a throw in there  Michael Carrick cut out the pass  intercepting if you like and now can go  on the attack maybe freshening it up  live a talk with the substitute now  we'll be dealt with easily by the  defenders there wasn't the great cross  in truth now they can build from the  back your position we are in the last  chance to learn to Liverpool all the  manager on the sidelines has made his  intentions clear he's waving quite a few  defenders forward I'm just going to get  that ball into the box whichever way is  possible  mata  and take it  in the skirt oh and it's a shot that the  goalkeeper can deal with quite  comfortably  trying to Liverpool  Loveland 18  or dispossessed that could be in trouble  try it  great save by a diving goalkeeper the  cross coming in when the ball deserve  perhaps a better response from his  teammates in the middle the defender got  there first though  wasteful pass unforced error really  Nathaniel Klein  schedule  that's a good challenge between the two  of them there and about up  in Memphis and he's not hitting with cow  has he but he's certainly hitting with  accuracy  little surprising that it is as  one-sided as this late in the game but  the team leading deserved the margin of  what's going to be a very comfortable  victory we're down now to the final two  minutes of the 90 skirt Lee oh just one  minute of added time to come Lucas  possession in the midfield area  he wants to play on the shoulder of the  last defender just got to get it right  it's all about timing  that's full time right  good seeds of 1415 for Manchester United  addicted shits a great work by the  keeper
 either again Marvin China here Allen  Swiss alongside me and it's Barclays  Premier League action for you for what  was amazing when makes the city won that  league in 2014  Chelsea did the double over than that  she did the double over the second place  team Liverpool as well so there was some  regrets I think at the end of that  season Chelsea got the edge over  mentioned the city today do you think  well it's a difficult one to call  Chelsea as always have defended really  well  this season and I'm going to make it  hard for City here  best defense in the league manchester  city while defendant is an art and  sometimes have forgotten one in this day  and age but these not haven't forgotten  in that's for sure    several changes por Manchester City Kyle  Walker starts with Marcelo as the  pullbacks Kevin de Bruyne er plays  alongside fernandinho in the middle of  the park Sergio agüero is the sole  striker    wholesale changes for Chelsea Thibaut  Courtois place today replacing Wilfredo  Caballero who have not looked that  confident lately  Andres Kristensen plays with Gary Cahill  in central defence mani gent water comes  in to assess fàbregas who's injured and  as our starts together with Murata  Manchester City well they'll be working  hard I'm sure their last game was an  away defeat against Swansea City well it  was one nil and they played they played  pretty well I think the large parts of  the game and for that reason I think now  probably win today the match under the  control of Mike Jones    match the city started this first half    now fernandinho    Marcello  have it the piranha  it's a taste of cross  well the cross came in that it went  straight to the opposition and now they  might break out get rid the browner  Sylva  and here's the shot it's a very worthy  effort she asked outside the post    Cahill  that's fit equator    they're waiting come here having drawn  their last two game we swish Street but  maybe not quite the winning mentality  that they may know but you wonder  whether a draw here would be  satisfactory whether they take that now  silver  Greta  our Walker trying to stretch the  opposition using the wider areas here  he spotted a teammate and has got the  technique as well as the vision to  switch to play  again at possession squandered really    Sylva    here's a chance to move forward from  midfield after that interception  Marcus Alonza  don't get a free kick for that    on EA sports very soon for you the  Champions Cup fixture Chelsea they'll be  hosting Roma yeah high quality fixed to  this one there won't be much quarter  given    Church terrific stop    Murata shots on here  sterling  agüero  looking to get the ball forward here  manchester city  is tackle well it's a good challenge  it's led to a corner    we've gotta shut up now a spell a  quitter who blocked a shot        mr. city looking for victory today but  won't be straightforward they understand  that  sterling cookie put agüero  as a  and it has out  because I should back with Manchester  City now    hi Walker  with the Bronner Marcello  well they look promising they're in that  wide area but the defenders done well  Kristensen  did he have the bowl again    here's Walker  Bernardino was my tackle very  successfully done  here we've got a free-kick given by the  referee      Kristensen  Murata does love having the pool this  fella just lent it to his teammate for a  moment  that's going to be a throw-in after that  tackle  Ruff's coming in now  help ease the pressure here sterling    it's going to be his TRO here    Sylva    we've got his tackle in the balls gone  out now  contact    agüero    comfortable.that for the goalkeeper  Murata  contact  Valentino  they can hit it here please hit it  straight at a keeper  not really what he wanted to do    fernandinho Manchester City are on the  attack now  take the chance with the shot there yeah  I thought you might have done better  that had a bit of time and space good  position    I've got the ball in the middle of the  pitch here  Marcela    here sterling    and there is the half-time whistle  nil-nil at the break  well it's level pegging at halftime and  the home defense which has been so solid  not quite so solid  yeah those defenders done their job  they're just looking to the attackers  now to Nick away      chelsey to start their second half there  get the Prada  Marcela  across it great work by the keeper    real good contest between these two as  they just look for possession and the  cross coming in    Sylva  the taco is successfully done  Nicholas autumn and a    I've been silver such a clever attacking  player and now that's not what Bert has  Billy Quetta want to keep the opposition  penned back this throw can help do that    with the Prada  our seller  fine cross when the board is perhaps a  better response from his teammates in  the middle the defender got there first  though  it's gone out of play and it will be a  throw from that two-headed clearance  sterling    or almost tackled out of play there and  that challenge and very confident to get  the game moving again  now Fernandina  contact    hey here    did he have the ball again    her goal kick    contact  illy strong tackle and the balls going  out for a throw having silver to be  substituted  Murata  Hayden has it  able to make a good interception shut up  the players have been unhappy about this  but we can see it again whether it  should have been offside or not it was  cold outside now who would be a linesman  de pista linesman is one of the best and  he gets it right here  Nicholas autumn and a time for the  substitutes I think to Chelsea  here's Walker    Valentino     off the bar  Manchester City have the ball again  Marcella well the balls been deflected  out throw-in  substitution coming up the Chelsea    it's a good challenge between the two of  them there and that clearly is a goal  kick so we can see again that effort on  gold from agüero yeah the head up it was  a bit of a wild attempt that hit with  power should have done better  with the bride  good new out shots on here      three substitutes and two of them coming  on together here  it's a header terrific stop well we've  been privileged to watch two of the best  goalkeepers and some of the sides  they've made have been outstanding    the corner has led to that effort at  goal which wasn't far away wasn't far  away and they did well to engineer a few  yards of space there  Cahill  tell you  contact  petrol    turn over there that we didn't expect  Walker    they're passing so well out there we  could be in particularly  they call from Des Moines up and well  that's evaded to keep this grass a  really good finish from him  well it's a goal worth replaying over  and over again isn't it    had to wait a while to get the first  goal of the game who sensed it was  coming it's finally arrived when you  think about football as a passing game  which it is you think about players like  him well they're back defending and  they've cut the pass out there and maybe  that will ease the pressure    it's too close to call this but they've  still got a one goal advantage chelsea  running out of chances now  well those defenders are going to be  astir this could be a chance just hit  the goalkeeper oh I know their positions  here they know their jobs defending this  corner  and here's the header got his head to it  well with no power welter to get there  first to find some space but couldn't  apply the finishing touch they've worked  so hard the team to be in front here  this could be it    Petro I've got this miss and equalizer  so late in the day late equaliser from  tej oh well he's hit it hard and he's  hit it first time but perhaps the keeper  could have got more on that  but let's take another look at the goal    so away we go at one all don't for  Chelsea    good new I  shut up well they could have been a shot  of significance it's turned out to be  shot of insignificance a selfish  decision that one from the player when  he could have easily passed it      the shuttle from narrow margins in the  match and in this incident yeah not far  off and that would have made a  difference to the outcome if you'd have  gone in  good luck    now Fernandina  Walker  looking for Marcello    and the referee has ended it here what  about this is a draw Alan lots of  attempts from one team well there wasn't  a lot of chances created Barton was  there but on the day they couldn't take  them and strikers particularly with your  disappointed    you
 hi there i'm martin Tyler and this is  the Bernabeu stadium it is a brilliant  brilliant fixture it's always been that  way other factors as well as football  involved in the rivalry here Barcelona  and Real Madrid well what an atmosphere  inside the stadium and what a match we  should have star-studded lineup see you  in front of us this is the Real Madrid  liner Keylor Navas in gold  Sergio Ramos plays with Pepe and central  defence  Tony Crow starts with Luka Modric in the  center of the park Karim Benzema is the  lone striker today  Barcelona's lineup here my conduct test  again starts in gold  Gareth PK starts with Javier Mascherano  as the centre backs  Iniesta plays with Sergio Busquets in  central midfield Luis Suarez is the lone  striker today this is an exercise in  patience as they try to get an opening  not rich  Benzema  here's a chance to attack tackle here  and they passed their way up into a good  position here then just lost the  concentration lost the ball as well we  work hard to try and get it back  it goes out wide again  masae  Barcelona winning a corner  that's it towards go and well done the  goalkeeper he's hung on to the ball  Pender's worry the break is definitely  on Cristiano Ronaldo are well saved  and that is a corner poor real Madrid  tries to punch it away  cries the true pass shut up he's blocked  the shot well coming up now a corner the  balls just deflected behind for that we  got a fist to it  we're talking now coming from Barcelona  I'll play you appeals but it is a corner  by that tackle  Jordi Alba well they're in a good  position here trying to find an opening  panicking free-kick against Real Madrid  that's going to be a yellow card for  this player become of any complaints  it has to  we went in well  really good attacking play Ramos is the  man  coming from Cristiano Ronaldo well  they're good at corners let's see what  this one brings think any football  family say when the rain comes down I  guess coming down now it's going  fish bells possibly money normally does  doesn't it and I always used to like it  because shots aren't here it blocked it  that and then covered out Barcelona  striving to get into their stride here  you  really trying to use the full width of  the pitch here to make some progress for  that look promising and he's been  stopped Roderick  they've got the ball back Barcelona any  ester  even rocket ish fight back  got a great understanding this team just  look at the passing gets his foot in  there and now NES de Barcelona get the  advantage Sergio Busquets  Barcelona on the attack terrific tackle  Gareth Bale Bale  come about how  honey close  crushes in the bore deserve perhaps a  better response from his teammates in  the middle the defender got there first  though  good defending  Gareth Bale  Vail Real Madrid looking good with this  attack  Roderich it's across from Gareth Bale it  becomes and times it and no great risk  you  here in the Bernabeu we're under way in  the second half  break maybe from Barcelona  defended to it first  throwing for Barcelona  TK Leonel messy  Iniesta  and they've got their new man ready  Barcelona to make the change keeps it  going well  a lot of defenders between them in the  goal but they still got the ball cross  coming from Cristiano Ronaldo  good clearance  crows what this attack got a bit of  menace to it  that's offside Cristiano Ronaldo just  failed to look across the line  cetera betcha  Sergio Ramos to get that ball it comes  to cross the ball deserve perhaps and  now the shot  lack of effort it's still level  Sergio Busquets Sergio Roberto  tada  it goes into the wider areas where  they've got a winger waiting  has been deflected out to be a throw-in  substitute buddies come out to Barcelona  short passes keeping the ball Jordi Alba  Tony Krause Marcella  on to Ronaldo  Karim Benzema still 20 minutes to go  trying to reach Benzema here come rayon  madrid made the challenge well well they  pass their way up into a good position  here and then just lost the  concentration lost the ball as well  they've got to work hard to try and get  it back  saw the pass coming and got there first  well this could be a really sharp camper  attack Karim Benzema  moving forward with some danger to the  opposition now they're here they've got  the ball back Barcelona  sérgio better little messy  some potential in this move and the  cross is in labor  don't you just love for late drama and  now they have the lead on no better time  I don't think there's any way back down  for the opposition that looks like the  winner had to wait a while to get the  first goal of the game since it was  coming it's finally arrived  that bench Barcelona what to make a  change now  great passing and the crowd really  enjoying it about to add well in a game  where it will go down to the wire that  could have really been a turning point  but he's missed the jumps he's getting  some stickers well off his own fans and  you can understand why they have  individual inspiration Real Madrid I  think they're going to need that as much  as team work now to get a goal to get  them something from this game  well we're nearly at white hanky time  when those fans show their displeasure  still chance for the Velma dude players  to turn things around  - and having a little game of their own  here bail and the pressure of getting  his team level maybe got to him because  he's made a hash of it I just wonder  whether a tree in Denis max they'll look  back on that chance is the one that cost  them dearly  well the clock is ticking on two minutes  of play left  country has chosen to add on two extra  minutes  sergio busquets break maybe from  barcelona say to you Roberto  wonderful jobs that's a fantastic dog  it's the substitute who's struck here  and he's done it really to help his team  so soon after coming into the game and  after win for Barcelona a few final  thoughts is there
 welcome along on a particularly wet and  miserable afternoon here conditions far  from ideal for this one any  international match is a special match  for those involved nothing quite like  playing for your country a nice  wonderful Club you know when you pull  that shirt on whether it's for the first  time or the 50th time it doesn't matter  it's still a great thrill  I suppose you grew up with Brazil and  probably the best football team in the  world when you were growing up with it  yeah I was a young boy watching the the  Brazil team in 1970 but they were  incredible weren't they and I think they  were over the benchmark for everything  that was good about the game of that  particular time with Pele and jazzy neo  and so many top-class players in it I  don't I think you know that there are  certain teams every now and again that  could span any generation and I think  that was one of them  Oh reflexes  he'll go Peugeot don't allow the room to  shoot  aside didn't quite get the run right  hold you run hold you run you don't need  to run that soon  liscus Tabo  he's good options here now  why you got to put on the ball of  winning  we're still looking dangerous  session has been given up here  cat tree  well  tane cross no trouble getting that one  away  Brazil have the ball advantage played  Brazil coming forward  well he can do far better than that it  was a away with effort but it's just so  wet now  well no excuses for me cause players  know about playing in the wet you should  have handled that better  stole a bowl that  Brazil won't be taking anything for  granted but I can't see them slipping up  hit license lags offside needed an  earlier pass that's a good decision but  it was a poor run wasn't it really  to make better use of the ball than that  Brazil could do something here  take another lead it was a game that was  crying out for something to happen and  it has they should improve the quality  of this match because it's been pretty  dull up to now  as he found someone  side  Reps way play on advantage brazilian  possession  referee's blown now is that a book of an  offense  it's a yellow he gets his name taken for  that it'll have to be careful now  normally so assured in the tackle but he  got that one horribly wrong that's a  yellow one the ball  thought that Brazil gets a hard time  with this lead still intact important  psychologically  Oh  liscus Tabo  Brazil looking dangerous not able to get  through  he's been taco  I'll take long  Eliska star bow  Valentin there will be a minimum of  three minutes  created the keeper made sure he held on  to it well cut out  start of the second half from Brazil  need to find a little bit more in these  next 45 minutes  very attacking approach here or the  goalkeeper had that  instant reactions  more pressure here from a corner  to my favorite action  not heed on  couldn't keep out of the ball  good it over all played in well-defended  name all  there's a cohesion about this team now  now can they make the most of possession  alert play that had to make the  interception Luis Gustavo  Oh gotta do better than that position  suggest rush that he's just grabbed at  that a little bit Clive and that's the  reason why is mr. great opportunity to  the world  as a moon  defending  well  Raziel coming forward  he's loved again he's going into one  corner to Brazil  did so well to get that away Raziel  could do something here  there's a real attacking intense about  them at the moment  pass intercepted  Brazil looking dangerous  it's a free cake and look where it is  still making  you  a change now  we're into the last 10 minutes now time  running out  you can't thread it through  we had to get to that  in the balance this could be a vital  corner  had any chance of getting on the end of  that go right across the pitch  George  it's funny isn't it I thought this was  going to be a bit of a mismatch just  shows how raw you can be quite they're  playing out their skins it it's a real  chance it was  and chance miss but they've got to get  that out of their minds now create  another it's important that you stay  focused and just keep the composure in a  situation like that that's a good  opportunity missed we have reached the  last of the 90 minutes Daniel Alves  now they are born with a and in villages  about to go up it's free free extra  bitters  Neymar  really good interception that  can't find a way through the referee is  called a halt night
 welcome to you all to this always  intriguing game but it might have  another element to it today I'm martin  Tyler Alan Smith I'll pose that question  to you what about the snow yes it's  coming down quite heavily at the moment  surely that's going to continue but and  there's a problem for the players  actually to see the ball the old orange  ball might be out before long  one side with banks repels the heist or  excite in the division and the other  team with the worst defense so should be  clear-cut here but the joy of football  is it rarely pans out that way yeah you  will imagine their eyes will be lighting  up just got to keep the concentration  and do what they have been doing the  home team  here's the lineup so Alan 4-4-2 yeah I  think it looks that way Martin yes it's  the conventional shape it's the one that  the manager prefers  with the way this manager likes to play  for is going to sit pretty much in place  and the to in midfield as well yeah  that's a defensive to won't be going too  far they won't be getting ahead of the  ball many times they'll be just trying  to feed it into those football ads  here's the referee will småland manataj  today  referee starts the match and the kickoff  Grievous  Neal  good for wordplay from them grievous  they've linked up well  to hit this no chance with that one too  high all the way  Neal  now they've got a chance in this part of  the pitch  okay a vinta  keeping the move going and in goes the  cross  and they're still going backwards all  the way to the goalkeeper  Rogers  right down the wing keeping the wide  attack going  rajat  David Gerard  there goes the cross looking for Jared  they took no chances there it's a  quarter for those who talk about a  winter break it's not something that in  England that anybody seems to have much  appetite for happily we'll be thinking  well this is the kind of weather way you  might want to be sitting at home rather  sitting in the stadium yeah I think it's  worse for the fans really number one  getting into the ground and and once  you're there sat there shivering for the  players it's okay yeah running about and  you're warm Gazza well he put the signal  up there but I don't think the teammates  recognized it broke down anyway yeah  back to the drawing board maybe back to  the training ground to practice that one  you might be true  better  and it's swerving away all the time from  the keepers grass no chance for him  peek at that goal  and that has opened the scoring one-nil  here  there's gerrae  Giovani Dos Santos trying to get behind  the defenders to get in a good crush  well you've got a complementing to try  and but that's well off target  well that's another there's another  angle coming up here Alan well he's just  decided to allow that one and he's flown  into the top right-hand corner  Reba's and in goes across  key  and goes across Robby kid  winter  bitter they labeled this time to answer  the girl he's got already yeah that  always a poor effort and never troubled  to keep up  an exhibition here with such great  passing  across it while the balls come out for a  goal kick  well there was that attempt that we  haven't really analyzed down and let's  look back on it now yeah I had to take  it quickly that volley and maybe Leaney  back that's what saw to him  go  Matteo's  the break is definitely on  while he's cleared the danger  Neal  call it  Neal and here's the cross here's a  chance to show how good they are at  corners that maybe increase their  advantage  is the cross  and he could get away here  does the cross he shut off now  one-nil here as the halftime whistle  goes well they've been scoring haven't  they the hosts but they've been  concealing as well so it's been in it  very invigorating game I must say  yeah not often that those strikers can  be kept quiet but doing it for 90  minutes is a lot more difficult  you might be through  bicha  oh and goes across Robbi kid  off the post  whistle from the referee and we're off  and running again for the second half  Giovani Dos Santos  it comes to Kraus  knocked away a lot  Neal  classic is top class  right the side  gerrae going into his stride now  now for a goal kick  Rivas  Neal  Gonzalez  and in goes the cross robbie keane  another one's gonna beggin which caching  isn't it what's that  five six players that have missed  sitters here today and that was the  chance to hit the target that's what  will disappoint him he didn't even work  the goalkeeper well all he had to do was  keep his eye on the ball keep his  concentration and he's got himself a  goal there  Neil cross it achieves that is a  fantastic goal  the ways hit that first time you cannot  blame the keeper at all because he said  it's so hard down the middle  to go well worth to analyzing again  restarting a tuna  Gonzalez  h8 eleganza  Grievous  we could be in  shorts on head comes out of the  goalkeeper  in the danger he's put it out it's gone  out for a corner  safety first there  he's looking for the cross that got the  ball in that wide area thereby the  interception  judi Nia  and the cross is in  Trinity down he's going to blame the  snow I think it looks nice watching it  come down but it's not too easy to keep  your balance on no one or two of the  players looking at the ref inquiringly  aren't you going to call this off get on  with it  that's a cross the field to try and  switch to play  Stephen Girard  key thrust coming in now that's a  splendid clearance  one of the sides is going to make a  change  Neal  treat him well  go kick  activity on the bench for the losing  team a substitute getting ready to come  off  Neal  past his van there  here's the shot okay we can only marry  it out  AJ DeLaGarza can they do it in these  closing minutes always true  the keeper  change in mind for LA Galaxy I think  not to a lot and I galaxies have a  throw-in a promising position  I can  at  winter  well in it and the manager is going to  make a change here  here's a jokes that's a fantastic goal  and he's just hitting so hard that it's  gone over the keepers head and he hasn't  got time to react  different angle on it here  if we go again to one  well one team has got a much better  ratio of shots to goals than the other  that's surprising isn't it  yeah then stats you would what you  manage it to see because they've been  wasteful and Thunder gone  it's a decent cross and he headed it  narrow margins in the match and in this  incident yeah not far off that would  have made a difference to the outcome if  he'd have got it  that's great work by the goalkeeper  there's the last blast on the whistle  today really bad weather today really  good game yeah we forgot about the  winner only ten minutes in because it  was so entertaining great stuff  you  better  and goes across Robbie Keane  off the post  Neal gonna cross it shoots is a  fantastic goal  Pastis man  here's the shot people can only carry it  out  can they do it in these closing minute  always true from the keeper  the manager is going to make a change  here here's a chance fantastic
 although experience can calm the nerves  in a penalty shootout  I'm sure there's always going to be an  element of doubt in the players minds      struck with some authority I thought was  a great strike you just gave the keeper  absolutely no chance    that's a huge start and his great-great  penalty to make a woody  was never easy to step up and take a  penalty but he  as I hold with  authority  please put it to the right side whites  fill the keeper with that one and send  them the wrong way  great penalty  I thought he did really well to hold his  nerve them and score that penalty  Oh brilliant stop Michele focus there  fantastic save putting this penalty away  for a two-goal lead would give them a  real psychological boost  so curved save by the keeper then the  keepers done really well to save that he  deserves a pat on the back from his  teammates to the keepers right well that  was a great strike you just gave the  keeper absolutely no chance  straight and true to go to the keeper  while he still look and struct up with  great confidence that's a superb spot  key keeper needs to keep this one out  for the wind so there's pressure on  taker and goalkeeper alike    it's there and his team fights on well  it's never easy to step up and take a  penalty but he slaughtered that Homewood  Authority    into the right side I thought he did  really well to hold his nerve down and  score that penalty  it is in there still in the game while  he strolled up and struck up with great  confidence that's a superb spot kick  the outsmarted the keeper and it's in or  the keepers been completely wrongful to  their superb strike rail Madrid are on  the brink there is no margin for error      yes he's put it away and his team breeds  a collective sigh of relief well that  was a great strike he just gave the  keeper absolutely no chance    too close to the goalkeeper oh that's a  super shade from the keeper he was  always looking good there nice penalty  realm at RIT now on the verge of defeat  if he doesn't score they're out    it's in and the supporters are on their  feet while he strolled up and stroked up  with great confidence that's a superb  spot kick    people are say hi  plastic but it's so clean over the fans  on their feet as down comes the curtain  on a true drama  they did well to hang on for the  shootout but maybe wishing they hadn't  when they crumbled under the pressure  yeah defeated in any of these type of  games as is the ultimate diss
 unless you count as we call it and Alan  Smith is with me here  apparently a lusty come to position and  welcome to you for me Martin Tyler as  well I mastered a buffalo that were  playing Delta V young an intimate feel  for his debut today is the Italian Marco  Galactic yeah an emerging talent well I  think he had emerged actually Italian  football so onto the end of twenty ones  and he was always going to be a top  talent it should be able to plan a wider  front college in May with the tiny of  this winger yeah a bit now I thought  previously so this will widen the  picture bit should be a good addition  wholesale changes to barthelona Satya  Bravo starts today requesting Martin  richest a good was injured surgery  Roberto starts the Jordi Alba as the  pullback Marco Verratti plays with even  recognition midfield Leonor Messi is the  main striker today Delta will play like  this today this is their 11 players well  it's pretty fashionable these days isn't  that the 4-3-3 gives you the three in  midfield which managers like to have  extra solidity yes that's right  are just looking at the two wide lines  of thought they are more central  strikers trying to do a job the interest  to see how they get on today expected or  certainly we didn't expect the site to  be in this curtain raiser and I got to  work with them I against what is a  really strong outfit interesting to see  this much Thunder at the referee for  this important fixture today Alvaro area  from era  the ganache Jordi Alba  here's across FA hey we're shot both  gold and the pieces before you marketing  water strike the Gulf of messy and top  left-hand corner to keep that only wave  is for high by different angle on it  here  okay  now the first goal is one else needs of  this will give the owner 50  Pablo's that having go across it  they can't keep it on the pitch is going  to have to throw  I'll be a masculine Thank You Roberto  birthday and the goalkeeper has done  well to stop that one  Espace he's got that too clever reading  of the game intercepting and getting  positioned back to his team  opportunity now and it's over the bar    but I see  they actually would not get down  if I put them up here we've gone for it  / - blue does it really are these are  lucky that you know because they didn't  have any time the defenders were closing  down so you have to take it early you're  picky just the heavy touch the  opposition could take the ball away take  you off now tight margins  it's just put too much on it it's over  the bar Jordi Alba  Yvonne racket  all sorts Messing  so chat about  right  yes in which other  a specialist  but happier and he put it away  beautifully he had made an immediate  impact with his go home the perfect  start for the London didn't take it well  and he wanted me to many better than  this over the years because that is just  our winni to the top right another angle  on it here  away we go at what all  even records  abandoned  Guga maíam that's the way to win the  ball back let's go great stop throwing  to Barcelona  Daniel Veit    he saw the guy could switch to play too  and came up with the past as well  excellent most safe to play back to  goalkeeper he's good with his feet  that's very good positional play and he  read the situation perfectly with that  interception collected behind a clear  corner well it could have scored so  close  if the diagonal Voltas switch the  playhead right    or the ball deserve perhaps the better  response from his teammates in the  middle the defender got there first  we could be it  but I see about a supposed to be pitch  and it's a goal kick  yeah Brown  have you a mess you up  Leonel metric  if you must  and he died cease to criticize but his  shooting is weak at the moment please go  back there Sheila's with himself but  he's got to calm down  still chance theater get on the  scoresheet way to prohibit now facile  address court here  and he was the top he's not in the  stadium batch of LASIK to the keepers  visor they want to see this again this  gold  awesome owner that with delayed  even Rockets  I think some people thought it was a  gamble to play him from the staff and to  go with a wide man well the manager got  it right good name well didn't he just  his teammates you could see in the early  stages just feeding the ball to him  because they know he's the man on song  at the moment  second half first leg the Super Cup de  espana in Spain the first half didn't  quite live up to the billing I think  maybe things will change now going to  cross it look at the little messy  kappa route  sérgio Roberto  if I be true bath day what's a fine save  coming up now a corner    and the balls taken from them they've  lost it now sorry and what about the  first 45 minutes he's played on his  debut today got himself a goal but he  does need a little bit of a helping hand  no Leto got a tee that's gone out for a  throwing well they're wasting no time  with the throw here  I love the tackle he's come for a throw  he could have been a bit luckier there  Fred and the cross coming in the lobby  act that is a terrific header unlucky  just off target they generated some  power on it and the keeper wasn't  getting there  Sergio Roberto almost ordered this  teammate to give it back to in there    and that will be a goal kick    Daniel vos that's a clever little clip  into a teammate the break is definitely  on little birthday I scored the golfer  messy and talked about placing it  exactly what do you want to do with it    we can see a slightly different  viewpoint on it      three-one the score line is where he  briefed out the game beautiful things  are you know who will be dealing with me  Fred Pablo Surabhi      good hands bread-and-butter work really  by the goalkeeper but he did it very  competently it's having a good game Yago  are fast always hit it too high    the Suarez    trying to stretch the opposition using  the wider areas here as the ball in they  cope with it well defensively  so they've lost of all the short-term  you could see the deflection their  corner comes out with a punch to clear  the danger  click head up down the teammate got a  chance the crop  and he fossil owner back on the ball now    this could be a chance he didn't declare  Neymar they've got into score here  I got her name us well he's just entered  back into the right house i daddy for a  wonderful take I have to say it's so  one-sided today but all credit to the  team that are racking up the goals ten  shots six on target to Barcelona well  have been okay could have done better  but certainly could have done worse here  good distance to the clearance then  a lot of speculation about the future of  Danny Galvez well I can tell you where  that future will be he has moved on to  Bayern Munich yeah and I think the fans  of this team will be delighted with the  acquisition he always gives hundred  percent they put that cross far too  close to the goalkeeper        we've seen a pass cut it out and in the  wing area now can maybe attack  cover out Fred  they spread it out wide here chance to  get some wit into this attacking contact  Fred    Pablo Surabhi now the referee thing that  is a foul it is a free-kick and it's a  headed effort at gold and not giving up  on it despite the number of goals there  behind    tablo's Sarabia  it's a quick break and just the good  apps and the raspberry has now called  the halt that's the first leg done in a  victory in the first leg of the super  cup de espana Spain's Super Cup so  nicely set up for the second leg it is  it's been an enjoyable tussle down now  it's all a part of their fitness regime  their pre-season training but we saw  some good skills so Leo Messi your  verdict Allen's red well so often we  think of these creative abilities but a  couple of goals here on the match to his  team  you  
   so it's away we go then  Jim who do you pick out as the telling  individual today I would say one of the  most energetic midfielders you'll find  in Jordan Henderson he's added to all  that running Tara with slicker passing  and some very impressive finishing and  and he's a proper leader now too well  quite no argument for me on that one  and the suit hits it back Castro    brings it forward    lalana to dwell to emerge with the ball  that's a contest to keep an eye on into  the channel there me know goes for the  cross it's lalana oh it's really drilled  it keeper felt he had that covered some  of the crowd were less convinced it was  really well drilled      and it's money more than happy to take  the muscular approach  now it's oppa meow place it into the  channel  Klein    casteau too close for comfort      money conjuring up some magic on the  right hand side all great run up to me  if it's done very well to get to that  well what can I say truly wonderful  goalkeeping      but defending albeit from an unexpected  salt and a finish go and Liverpool score  first a high quality goal lovely first  touch sumptuous second    Borussia Dortmund fail at its early  stage how will they respond famiy No    money man a that's really nice now what  next  the shuts on could stop that wasn't easy  well you can't ask for much more than  that a difficult moment he simply had to  deal with    shake the shoots  aim blow and direct    castro goes looking boys looking to get  on the end of this well when the options  aren't quite president in the box it's  the crossers interest to to hold on for  the support it's gone for a throwing    now it's Obama a always broken through  threw himself at it but he's got it  cleanly no complaints about that  challenge robust but fair  that's a good blog but at the expense of  a corner    so what's he planning here so couch run  down the left hand side  Guerrero place it in timely intervention    Castro  surely    he acknowledges that he should have come  up with something better that I was too  timid to make it through that if he's  been bundled over that is a foul  Matan gets his final warning this an  opportunity to pull level this certainly  looks appetizing well with inch he's  gone for coal that was traveling    Henderson looks like a good ball through  he's off on a maraud looking to shoot  Ward the fall from Roberto Firmino  and this is getting better and better  the amino was quick to move in Kieffer's  handling wasn't great our players like  this fella almost have a sixth sense to  get themselves in such great coaching  positions how quick minded was that    Liverpool ticket to go lead and things  should be comfortable from here on in  well that second goal has given them so  much more command and confidence now and  they should be able to take it on from  here and either add to their lead or  close it out surely they'll manage one  or the other    Castro    tries to dink it in Firmino place it  back and he's there to cut it out get  arrow and they'll the breakaway    looks to slip it through Mario kertzer  has a hit  for it goes is it in  goes for it oh great save real class  well that was high class goalkeeping  there to back up is is high class wait    and have to say that was an exemplary  tackle stopped him dead in his tracks  Liverpool in control at halftime to nil  we have propped the into the second 45  minutes and it's Royce steered out wide  now here's the flue ball hits it he's  been taken down and the referee has  pointed at the spot Liverpool have  conceded a penalty and that's gonna be a  booking well he'd used up all this  chances hadn't he Peter I mean he was  never going to get away with that one  well I think the alternative was to  stand there and do nothing while he  tried to score and obviously he's not  going to allow that Peter is he eyeball  to eyeball with the goalkeeper  oh it's hit the door    Philippe Coutinho could challenge he  just stood firm    let's take it out that'll be a foul    that's the booking always looked it    build up  fine Eldon  lalana klein some promising run he's  making on the right deflect it behind  for a corner kick    bar truck gets it away and it's fine  album via album  chills one in Liverpool making a fresh  attempt to release someone in behind  from back to front and this is something  different that had to be more accurate    now it's oppa Mia  fine Eldon  Cimino    Castro  and it's good sir he's left his man  played out to the wing schürrle heads  it's still well to get his head on that  but couldn't score I have to commend the  wing plate but I have to condemn the  defending they've got to stop the cross  out to the flank just about up to the  hour now  they're meaner crate challenge  Castro  it's a phobia  going through oppa my yang place each  one Nixon    well you know thinking about that I  think they've perfected that on the  training ground because it took them  seconds to get the ball from back to  front and they really commit forward at  numbers too it was all very well drilled  this is threatening to become a really  good game well it was important they  didn't get ahead of themselves and lose  their did  that's an untidy challenge free-kick  given well you might think he got off  lightly it is just a verbal warning      continue who still hammered it  and that would have been some goal he  almost benefited from some real  generosity no wonder that keepers going  nuts it so nearly came off for him yeah  he's been at the center of a lot of  things hasn't he mostly good  I should add famiiy know this is  promising he's gone away  man a great tackle II had to get that  right  Castro plays it forward  it's the throat    that's not gonna go down too well with  his teammates Castro  it's nice to get it forward quickly  sugar gold Oh bunny goal of the glorious  goal and it's another really good show  of character I love the spirit and  togetherness they must never know when  they're beaten  looking back at that that's how you play  on the counter quick and decisive and  ruthless with the finish I thought it  was a stunning stunning breakaway  this has become one superb game of  football I look Peter I was on the fence  before a ball was kicked and I still  haven't moved a real church to break  he's left his man now the pass a child  adds rice great build-up it all deserved  a better ending  Royce surely had to be sharper in making  the most of his one-on-one it's not as  if it's his first time either oh he  really wanted that yeah and you can hear  how the crowd are reacting to this - and  it's Royce he's through now is he in    concentration levels are very good and  so is the commitment this game could yet  yield a winner and ease away driving or  he could shoot here but they're looking  at the referee but he's worse he Altman  showing a good level of intensity at  this stage they're calling on all their  resources now throws wide look this can  still go either way it might be flowing  one way but there's still time for some  ed    Mario götze little tell that is a foul    he knew what was coming that's a yellow  card the players are flocking around  their fallen colleague and they look  worried    Castro dick swollen  borussia dortmund merit full marks for  their attitude and application in trying  to win this it means an awful lot  obviously    and it's noise out to the left it goes  Castro  Mario götze  he's got away with one there while the  work great to win the ball back was  fantastic and had set up the opportunity  that's great effort  so time the shots on borussia dortmund  showing a good level of intensity at  this stage they're calling on all their  resources now Manny  has got himself a free-kick and he's  gonna have his name taken    Klein  it's losing impossible to wrestle off  the ball shoots and a second time and it  goes and surely that's the winner  vine Eldon at his razor-sharp bash there  but for me that's just pure predatory  brilliance it's not so much to finish  but the way he read the situation when  nobody else was even alert to it it's  fantastic    Liverpool and that's it
